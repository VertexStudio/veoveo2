# UAV Simulation MCP Server

The UAV Simulation server owns the governed control surface for one authoritative
simulation runtime. The same runtime advances physics, owns the stage and streamed
world, derives operator cameras from current entity transforms, renders those cameras,
and produces their encoded video. No second process mirrors the scene or replays poses
for visualization.

> A simulation MCP server exposes governed logical cameras rendered by its authoritative
> simulation. All streamable cameras occupy typed regions in one continuous tiled RTX
> render and NVIDIA NVENC product. Every browser decodes that atlas once and presents
> each region as an independent camera canvas. Camera smoothing operates once on each logical-camera
> transform and never changes or delays authoritative simulation state.

## Standards And Protocols

| Standard or protocol | Supported profile |
|---|---|
| Model Context Protocol | Version `2026-07-28` over the repository stateless Streamable HTTP profile, including Discover, tools, resources, templates, `subscriptions/listen`, official Tasks, and one MCP App. |
| JSON Schema | Draft 2020-12 strict request, result, camera, tiled-product, region, and health schemas. |
| `veoveo.io/live-view/v4` | Repository-owned provider-neutral profile for authoritative cameras, typed regions in shared encoded products, viewer authorizations, WebSocket H.264 endpoints, and redacted state. |
| `veoveo.io/uav-runtime-event/v2` | Private authenticated HTTP/1.1 NDJSON stream carrying an `adapter_ready` edge before world admission and a final `ready` edge after authoritative visual admission. It is an internal adapter event, not a public MCP resource or a simulation control protocol. |
| WebSocket and H.264 | RFC 6455 binary messages under subprotocol `veoveo.h264.annexb.v1`; each message carries one decoder-reentrant or predicted Annex B H.264 access unit. The encoded atlas is H.264 Main Profile Level 5.0, advertised to WebCodecs with the exact RFC 6381 codec string `avc1.4d4032`. One tiled NVIDIA NVENC atlas fans out unchanged to authenticated viewers. This WebSocket is a media adapter, not a public simulator-control protocol. |
| OpenUSD and RTX Hydra | Isaac Sim `6.0.1` stage and render products inside the authoritative runtime. These are implementation details, not MCP wire types. |
| Native sensor video | Isaac Sim `6.0.1` packages `omni.kit.livestream.aov` `10.2.0` and `omni.kit.livestream.rtsp` `10.2.3`. The private adapter consumes the loopback RTSP/RTP H.264 stream without decoding or re-encoding. This is not an MCP wire type. |
| RTSP, RTP, and H.264 | RTSP 1.0 over loopback TCP with interleaved RTP/RTCP. The adapter supports the RFC 6184 single-NAL, STAP-A, and FU-A packetization modes and emits decoder-reentrant Annex B access units. |
| OGC 3D Tiles | Cesium Omniverse `0.29.0` with pinned Cesium Native commit `ca0311f25c412b74ad1af9a3636924122cc76156`, one simulator-owned world, and one cache. The repository extension adds private redacted lifecycle events; it does not add an MCP wire protocol. |
| WGS 84, ECEF, ENU, NED, and FLU | Explicit world, physics, entity, rig, and camera coordinate boundaries. |
| `veoveo.io/map-route-handoff/v1` | Map MCP-owned, execution-neutral route projection with exact route, digest, mobility-profile, snapshot, release, restriction, and validation provenance. |
| `frames://world/{world_id}/revision/{revision_id}` | Frames MCP-owned immutable world revision identity consumed by session configuration and mission admission. |
| MAVLink 2 | Private PX4 command, telemetry, actuator, and HIL sensor integration. The protocol is not projected as high-rate MCP traffic. |
| Rerun RRD | Version `0.36.0` recording data and producer-authored Blueprint stores sent independently to Recording Hub. |
| NVIDIA Container Runtime | One Kubernetes GPU allocation with compute, graphics, utility, and video driver capabilities. CPU rendering and encoding are unsupported. |

## Authority Boundary

The simulation runtime is authoritative for physics, entity transforms, the OpenUSD
stage, Cesium georeference, domain sensors, operator cameras, Hydra render products,
and NVENC products. The Rust server owns caller authorization, principal-to-vehicle
grants, mission admission, exclusive command leases, MCP state projection, ephemeral
stream authorizations, WebSocket admission, and access audit. Map MCP owns operational
geography, place resolution, mobility profiles, restrictions, routing, and the route
handoff. Frames MCP owns world trees and immutable revisions. The UAV server consumes
those exact products and never reimplements either vertical.

The cluster-private adapter is the only boundary between those responsibilities. It exposes
typed configuration, command, state, and live-stream operations. It does
not carry a visualization pose stream. No MCP request participates in the physics or
render loop.

             +---- browser N: one decode -> five cropped canvases
```

Simulation never waits for recording, Rerun playback, audit persistence, a browser, or
an MCP consumer. Those boundaries may report failure, but they cannot stop authoritative
physics.

## MCP Surface

The server owns the `uav-sim://` scheme, slug `uav-sim`, MCP path `/uav-sim/mcp`,
and port `8802`.

The domain tools govern session configuration, simulation execution, single-vehicle
mission admission, dataset capture, and typed inspection. Vehicle authority uses:

- `list_active_vehicle_control_grants`
- `grant_vehicle_control`
- `revoke_vehicle_control`
- `prepare_vehicle_mission`
- `execute_vehicle_mission_plan`

`list_active_vehicle_control_grants` is the tool projection of the canonical grant
resources for clients whose execution surface exposes tools but not resource reads. It
applies the same tenant, Work Context, caller-visibility, session, revocation, and
validity filters as the resource surface. Its Map mobility-profile URI is an authority
binding, not a copy of Map work data. Map MCP remains authoritative for the referenced
profile and every route derived from it.

The old public multi-vehicle `execute_mission` surface does not exist. The simulator's
typed multi-vehicle adapter request is cluster-private and cannot establish principal
authority. The live-view profile adds:

- `list_live_cameras`
- `open_live_view`
- `renew_live_view`
- `close_live_view`

Live state uses these canonical resources:

- `uav-sim://session/{session_id}/live-cameras`
- `uav-sim://session/{session_id}/live-camera/{camera_id}`
- `uav-sim://session/{session_id}/stream-products`
- `uav-sim://session/{session_id}/stream-product/{product_id}`
- `uav-sim://session/{session_id}/live-views`
- `uav-sim://session/{session_id}/live-view/{live_view_id}`
- `uav-sim://control-grants`
- `uav-sim://control-grant/{grant_id}`
- `uav-sim://mission-plans`
- `uav-sim://mission-plan/{plan_id}`

`ui://uav-sim/live.html` is the only live-view App resource. There are no aliases for
the removed hosted viewer service, scene mirror, or pose protocol. An installation may
declare exact generic agent ids with `UAV_SIM_AGENT_MESSAGE_TARGETS`. The App resource
publishes that closed list through the Apps extension, and the Console's authenticated
human-message bridge projects it into App host context. This gives the domain App a
prompt surface without granting the iframe agent credentials or adding UAV concepts to
the Console.

## World And Session Lifecycle

`configure_world` binds a session exactly once to an immutable Frames world revision and
static simulation frame. The adapter derives the WGS 84, ECEF, ENU, NED, stage, and
Cesium mappings from that binding. Runtime configuration is immutable after admission.

Always-on installations mount the already-admitted binding from an installation-owned
ConfigMap. The MCP companion parses the strict document and applies it once during
startup. It does not begin serving when the file is absent, malformed, cross-revision,
or rejected by the simulator. This is startup configuration, not durable renderer state:
there is no poller, retry scheduler, desired-versus-realized model, or periodic replay.
Installations that intentionally begin unconfigured omit the mount and use the ordinary
tool once.

Durable task tools use `interrupted_indeterminate` recovery. An unclean interruption
never replays physical work. The default fleet controller keeps the configured fleet
on its admitted loop until a later mission command takes authority.

## Vehicle Authority And Mission Admission

An authenticated gateway principal controls a vehicle only through a UAV-owned grant.
The grant binds the exact principal key, Work Context, session, vehicle, permissions,
validity interval, and one versioned Map mobility-profile URI. Initial showcase policy
uses one principal per vehicle. This is packaging policy rather than a platform concept;
the UAV contract also supports bounded many-to-one grants when a later use case admits
them explicitly.

`inspect`, `plan`, `execute`, and `abort` are separate permissions. A caller with only
`uav-sim:control` sees telemetry for vehicles covered by a current `inspect` grant. The
`uav-sim:read` and `uav-sim:admin` scopes retain domain-wide operator visibility. Tool
metadata, an agent manifest, a chat target, or a claimed vehicle ID never creates
vehicle authority.

Mission admission has one vertical handoff:

```text
operator prompt
  -> Map MCP resolves places, applies active data, and routes
  -> Map MCP prepares veoveo.io/map-route-handoff/v1
  -> UAV MCP verifies grant, profile, provenance, freshness, and Frames revision
  -> UAV MCP persists one principal-bound single-vehicle plan
  -> UAV MCP acquires the exclusive vehicle command lease
  -> private simulator adapter executes the admitted waypoints
```

The handoff contains WGS 84 geometry and Map provenance, but no UAV command semantics.
The UAV server converts its admitted path into the private simulator request, applies
the granted speed and destination hold, and never asks Map to execute a vehicle. Mission
plans expire after 15 minutes. Route validation may be at most five minutes old when a
plan is admitted. Every executable position requires ellipsoidal height. A
planning-advisory route is accepted only when the vehicle grant says so.

Execution acquires one durable exclusive lease for the Work Context, session, and
vehicle. A concurrent mission for that vehicle fails closed. Completion, failure,
cancellation, task-start failure, and task-lease loss all finalize the mission plan and
release the exact command lease. Physical task interruption remains indeterminate and
is never replayed. Admission may reclaim an unreleased lease only when no matching
mission plan remains in the executing state. This repairs terminal finalization residue
without weakening exclusion for active work.

Restart behavior is intentionally simple. Simulator objects are runtime state. A pod
restart recreates the configured world, cameras, and products through the one-shot
installation binding. Stream authorizations disappear when the MCP server restarts, and
the App opens new authorizations. WebSocket or decoder failures start a fresh
authorization sequence with a five-second maximum backoff for selected cameras. The App
renews its resource subscription before every open attempt, so an MCP companion restart
cannot strand recovery behind a stale session subscription. A subscribed live-camera
resource update immediately retries cameras waiting for simulator readiness. The runtime
emits an
`adapter_ready` edge after its preconfiguration endpoint binds, allowing an existing
companion to reapply the same immutable installation binding after an independent
simulator-container restart. It emits a second `ready` edge after its running lifecycle
and streamed-world readiness are both current; that edge produces the subscribed resource
update. Both use a private Unix datagram. Delivery is best effort and never delays the
simulator. If the companion is absent, its later startup applies the installation binding
directly. Closing a tile or tearing down the App cancels its reconnect state. A selected
camera keeps retrying at the capped backoff until it succeeds, is deselected, or the App
tears down. There is no desired-versus-realized renderer deployment or periodic replay
controller.

The streamed-world data plane has a smaller reactive lifecycle inside the simulator.
The pinned Cesium extension emits a typed event when the ion endpoint, root tileset, or
tile content request fails. Events contain only the tileset path, load generation, load
type, and HTTP status. Provider URLs, keys, sessions, tokens, headers, and response bodies
never enter the event or projected runtime state.

A rejected tile-content session produces one generation-safe replacement. The runtime
keeps the resident native tileset mounted and preserves Cesium's persistent response
cache. Each native tileset generation bypasses the two endpoint caches for its small ion
bootstrap request, which guarantees a new provider session without deleting cached tile
content. Duplicate failures from the rejected generation collapse into the same action.
Native load completion alone does not promote the replacement. Loaded tiles, prepared
geometry, prepared materials, and rendered geometry must all increase beyond the resident
baseline and remain visible for the configured readiness window. Only then does the
runtime retire the expired tileset. A rejected or unproven replacement is removed after
the bounded 120-second registration-and-coverage window, and the lifecycle becomes
`degraded` without a replacement loop. Credential, quota, asset, and root-provider
failures are typed directly and never masquerade as a provider-session replacement.
An isolated transport or provider failure for child tile content remains observable in
`last_failure`, but it does not withdraw an already proven textured resident generation.
If rendered geometry or loaded materials disappear after that failure, visual readiness
fails closed immediately. Stable textured coverage can then restore readiness without a
cache reset or a speculative replacement.

Render statistics describe current coverage; they do not infer network failure. Zero
visible tiles can be valid while a camera crosses an unavailable footprint or while
refinement is active, so no elapsed-time or visibility threshold triggers provider work.
This lifecycle can change visual readiness, but it cannot change simulation readiness,
physics, pose flow, missions, recording publication, or an already active native camera
product.

## Authoritative Operator Cameras

Configured logical cameras are created under `/World/OperatorCameras`. Each camera has a
stable logical ID, revision, final smoothed pose, and typed atlas region. A
browser authorization never mutates that definition or its product lifecycle.

The admitted rig set is:

| Rig | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `fixed` | Applies an exact world pose without smoothing state. |
| `look_at` | Keeps the configured eye and follows a world point or entity through orientation. |
| `orbit` | Holds a configured radius, elevation, and azimuth around one authoritative entity. |
| `follow_entity` | Applies FLU eye and target offsets to the current entity transform. |
| `chase_entity` | Derives a trailing eye and target from the same current entity transform. |
| `stabilized_mounted_entity` | Composes an entity and mount transform, then smooths the operator view only. |
| `formation_overview` | Frames the current centroid and bounds of a configured entity set. |

Every rig claimed by the contract has deterministic desired-pose tests. Operator-camera
transforms never feed back into an entity, sensor, mission, or physics state.

## Camera Smoothing

Smoothing uses a frame-rate-independent exponential filter over the final desired camera
pose. Translation uses linear interpolation. Orientation uses normalized shortest-arc
quaternion SLERP.

```text
alpha = 1 - 2^(-dt / half_life)
```

The typed profile contains `translationHalfLifeMs`, `rotationHalfLifeMs`,
`teleportDistanceMillimetres`, and `resetAfterGapMs`. Zero half-life snaps the relevant
component. A target change, camera revision, simulation generation, long render gap, or
teleport resets the filter. The filter stores one previous camera pose and no entity-pose
history.

Chase eye and target calculations consume the same authoritative transform at one
physics step. Formation cameras consume one snapshot of all selected entity transforms.
This prevents camera-target disagreement without delaying simulation.

## Render Products

Isaac Sim's Experimental Camera API batches every streamable USD camera with common
optics. One RTX view-tiled Hydra product binds the complete camera relationship into a
stable texture and LdrColor AOV. The 3-column by 2-row product is 3840x1440 for five
1280x720 cameras and owns one pod-loopback RTSP port pair, H.264 identity, and NVIDIA
NVENC session. No Replicator or RGB annotator is loaded, and raw atlas pixels never
enter Python. The runtime submits every camera viewport to Cesium in the same Kit frame.
Headless operation disables the pinned
Cesium extension's interactive viewport-window update subscription, leaving one
authoritative viewport writer instead of racing an empty GUI inventory. The runtime does
not create another Cesium world, provider connection, georeference, material set, or
cache.

The atlas starts with immutable world admission and renders continuously. A native
RTSP receiver depacketizes its exact access units into a 256-entry keyframe-aware ring.
The WebSocket handler gives each viewer its own cursor, begins at the newest
decoder-reentrant keyframe, and advances without decoding or re-encoding. A slow viewer
cannot block the render loop or another connection.

The runtime timestamps the camera batch when the current authoritative entity snapshot becomes
its USD camera poses. The corresponding Hydra drawable event closes that source-to-render
interval without copying pixels to the CPU. The product retains the latest 256 samples and publishes their
nearest-rank p95 in integer microseconds. The runtime never uses a wall-clock sampler or
health poll to produce latency evidence.

Live viewing has no lease pool, admission counter, viewer quota, or camera-selection
limit. The persistent atlas is already running. Additional users allocate ordinary
WebSocket delivery and one browser decoder, never another simulator render or encode.

The domain nadir sensor and operator cameras have independent cadence. The physical
sensor camera receives the exact current body-and-mount transform at render cadence.
Cesium receives that viewport every Kit update. The sensor Hydra product renders at the
declared sensor rate and publishes its CUDA-resident `LdrColor` AOV directly to the
native RTSP extension. No Replicator orchestrator participates in simulation timing.

The manual Isaac loop advances fixed physics from elapsed monotonic time. It preserves
bounded physics debt and coalesces missed visual deadlines into one render of the newest
authoritative state. RTX, Cesium, NVENC, H.264 delivery, Recording, and Rerun work can reduce
presentation cadence under load, but none of them changes the simulation clock.

The RTSP extension performs one NVIDIA NVENC encode and serves the resulting GOP on a
pod-local loopback transport. The private adapter depacketizes RFC 6184 payloads without
decoding, copying pixels, or encoding again. It qualifies SPS, PPS, IDR, and predicted
access units, then fans each exact encoded access unit to Recording/Rerun and the
optional live RTP publisher. Raw sensor pixels never enter Python or Recording.
Every RTSP AOV also receives an explicit internal signal-port reservation adjacent to
its RTSP listener. These port pairs remain pod-local and are never viewer endpoints.

Recording Hub admits ordinary H.264 GOPs and rolls storage only at a decoder-reentrant
IDR boundary. The sensor path exposes its declared rate, monotonic observed-frame count,
last encoded size, and keyframe state. Headed hardware-backed browser acceptance verifies
the actual visual content; runtime health does not require a diagnostic pixel readback.

## Viewer Authorization And Shared Products

A logical camera belongs to the Work Context output owner and occupies one immutable
region of the continuous atlas. Opening any camera binds the gateway actor and
browser-instance identity to that camera and returns a secret stream token. Cameras,
users, tabs, and browser profiles all resolve to the same stream-product identity and
exact encoded access units.

Only `open_live_view` and `renew_live_view` return the token. Resources contain redacted
authorization state. The server retains a SHA-256 token hash in memory and compares it in
constant time. Renew rotates only that authorization. Close, expiry, and teardown revoke
only that viewer. None of those actions starts or stops the atlas.

The live-stream gate authenticates the WebSocket upgrade, maps the authorization to its
camera, and injects the private runtime credential. The runtime sends one complete Annex
B access unit per binary message from a bounded keyframe-aware ring. Each connection gets
its own cursor and backpressure, while the renderer and NVIDIA NVENC session remain one
for the entire atlas. There is no viewer quota, media relay, duplicate encode, or GPU-to-CPU pixel
readback.

Authorization expiry uses one exact deadline task. Close, expiry, revocation, and stream
teardown update only connection state. Neither path polls. Runtime health is read on
demand and announced through MCP subscriptions.

## Audit And Failure Isolation

Open, denial, close, expiry, camera mutation, and product-activation rejection produce
typed access events. The platform store appends each accepted audit record and outbox
projection atomically. Tokens, native endpoints, media, and provider credentials never
enter audit data.

An audit-store outage is logged with the typed action and authorization identity. It
cannot roll back an already-issued authorization, interrupt a viewer, or stop simulation.

The GPU Deployment starts the authoritative simulator and recording forwarder together.
The independent MCP Deployment starts whenever the platform database is reachable and
reports unavailable until the authenticated simulator adapter answers. A Gateway, MCP,
or recording outage cannot prevent or restart simulation. The simulator's
preconfiguration API exposes product state but no product mutation route. Immutable world
admission starts the configured camera atlas.

Gateway authority is evaluated for every MCP open, renew, close, and resource read. If
the same actor and browser instance presents a changed output owner, policy revision, or
data-label authority at renewal, the server closes that authorization, records
`viewer_authority_revoked`, and leaves every unrelated viewer attached to the shared
product. Other rejected renewals record `renew_denied`. Expiry invalidates the stream
connection even when the browser disappears without teardown.

## Live App

The App discovers the authoritative camera collection and opens the atlas when its first
camera is selected. Every other selected camera attaches its typed crop to that same
player. Renewal is transparent, and removing one canvas cannot interrupt the remaining
cameras. Tearing down the App closes the browser's atlas authorization.

Each tile reports requested and decoded dimensions, cadence, frame age, transport state,
camera health, smoothing profile, and attribution. Cadence values use fixed-width,
zero-padded integer labels with tabular monospace numerals, so telemetry updates do not
move or wrap the video overlay. Media Capabilities labels H.264
decode as hardware only when the browser reports `powerEfficient`; supported smooth
software decode is labeled explicitly. Browser acceptance still requires a headed,
hardware-backed WebGPU or WebGL context.

The App asks WebCodecs for hardware-preferred decode of each Annex B H.264 atlas frame,
then draws its five typed regions into independent GPU-composited canvases. It claims
hardware decode only when Media Capabilities reports `powerEfficient`; otherwise the UI
uses the documented smooth software H.264 decode label and exception.

Focused browser acceptance combines the runtime source-to-render window with reactive
canvas frame events and browser receive-to-display measurements. It rejects
source-to-render p95 at 85 ms and motion-to-photon p95 at 250 ms. The measured reference
profile schedules Kit presentation at 24 Hz, targets 16 FPS, and rejects delivery below
12 FPS. Smoothing response is reported
by the camera profile and is not counted as transport latency. The same run opens all
five cameras for five concurrent browser users, proves 25 advancing camera canvases use
five browser connections to exactly one simulator product and one NVENC session, then
proves closing every viewer leaves that product ready.

Restart acceptance keeps the same headed App document and viewer-instance identity
mounted while independently restarting the MCP pod and the Isaac container. MCP restart
evidence requires the simulator pod UID, container ID, and restart count to remain
unchanged. Each recovery must produce a new authorization, advancing native video, and
unchanged hardware-browser evidence. The atlas product identity remains stable.

The MCP image uses a minimal PID 1 shell that forwards pod termination to one
Rust child and exits with that child. Restart acceptance terminates that sole child
through `kubectl exec`, which lets kubelet restart the MCP container without replacing
its pod or the authoritative simulator Deployment. No restart endpoint or public
control surface exists.

Physical-camera state includes a bounded `render_pose` agreement measurement after the
first rendered frame. It reports the rendered ENU position and forward direction beside
their position and angular error from the authoritative body-and-mount pose. Absence
means that no rendered frame is available yet; it is not synthesized from simulation
state.

## Deployment

The UAV chart deploys one GPU runtime Deployment and one independent MCP Deployment.
Only the Isaac container requests one GPU and receives
`compute,graphics,utility,video` NVIDIA capabilities. Pod-loopback RTSP port pairs are
derived from the configured camera collection and validated by the chart.

The runtime Service exposes the authenticated adapter and private H.264 WebSocket to the
MCP pod. The MCP Service owns MCP HTTP and the public authenticated live-stream gate.
Separate network policies admit
only those edges, platform dependencies, DNS, and the configured public TLS world
provider. Provider and adapter credentials come from distinct installation-owned
Secrets and never appear in Helm-rendered ConfigMaps or MCP state.

The runtime retains its latest typed lifecycle edge and exposes it on the authenticated
NDJSON stream. The MCP consumer reconnects only after transport failure, receives the
latest edge immediately, reapplies the immutable binding after `adapter_ready`, and
projects final `ready` through the subscribed live-camera resource. A missing consumer
never blocks the runtime.

The platform chart contains no generic simulation renderer, pose ingress, mirror cache,
or live-view GPU workload. External simulation implementations package the same
domain-owned boundary in their own release.

## Recording Isolation

Recording publication is asynchronous and bounded. Queue pressure may drop recording
events according to the recording policy, but it never delays physics, camera transforms,
or operator rendering. A Recording Hub, Rerun, object-store, or browser failure changes
recording health only.

The recording producer emits one recording store plus an associated producer Blueprint.
The Blueprint selects the fleet, leader camera, and map views. Viewer-local layout changes
remain separate from that producer default.

## Conformance And Acceptance

Deterministic coverage proves strict camera parsing, all rig computations, half-life
behavior at several frame rates, shortest-arc normalization, reset rules, stable product
identity, 25-viewer fan-out, token rotation, expiry, WebSocket authorization, and App
teardown.

The external fixture proves that another simulation server can own its camera/product,
viewer, stream, and App contract without importing an Isaac-specific renderer or a
pose-mirroring protocol. First-party visual certification remains the GPU UAV showcase.

Hardware acceptance requires one NVIDIA GPU, a headed hardware-backed browser, RTX
rendering, NVIDIA NVENC, advancing H.264 frames, several authoritative cameras, correct
Cesium alignment, shared-product multi-viewer evidence, and no software renderer,
encoder, or media relay. It also proves delivery of at least 12 FPS, source-to-render
p95 below 85 ms, and browser receive-to-display composition below 250 ms from reactive frame
events. The smoke entry points

```

## Contract Compliance

The server implements MCP contract revision 2. Its control-plane registration declares
that revision and the complete tool, resource, subscription, task, and App capabilities.
Compliance gaps are not hidden in deployment values or fixture behavior.
