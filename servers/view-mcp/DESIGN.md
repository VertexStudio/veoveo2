# View MCP Design

This document is the canonical design and operational contract for the
`view-mcp` crate.

`view-mcp` captures reproducible points of view over governed static scene
compositions. Each composition binds one configured georeferenced 3D Tiles
layer to exact Map, Frames, Artifact, Recording, or simulation-owned inputs and
bounded declarative overlays. The service runs Bevy without a window, keeps
bounded tile and GPU residency across captures, and returns images with exact
composition provenance.

## Status

Implemented in this workspace.

The canonical service identity is:

```text
crate       veoveo-view-mcp
folder      servers/view-mcp
slug        view
URI scheme  view
MCP         /view/mcp
health      /view/healthz
readiness   /view/readyz
```

Gateway-mounted tools use names such as `view__capture_frame`. Resource
identities keep the `view://` scheme.

## Standards And Protocols

| Standard or protocol | Implemented profile |
|---|---|
| [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) | JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP with view tools, task-only capture, resources and templates, completions, subscriptions, notifications, image content, and structured results. |
| [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/) | Camera, immutable scene composition, overlay geometry, capture policy, layer, tile, frame, and structured-result contracts. |
| MCP Tasks extension `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` | Version `2026-07-28`; frame capture uses durable creation, progress, cancellation, terminal `tasks/get` payloads, and `subscriptions/listen`. |
| [MCP Apps SEP-1865](../../mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md) | `ext-apps` version `2026-01-26`; `ui://view/preview.html` drives canonical resources, direct view tools, and task-based capture. |

## Boundary

Map owns geographic source truth, immutable releases, derived geometry, and
the `map://` identities supplied to a composition. Frames owns local coordinate
authority. Artifact owns governed large bytes. View validates and snapshots
those exact inputs, then owns declarative visual styling, visibility, camera
state, 3D Tiles traversal, GPU rendering, and captured-frame provenance.

View does not derive routes, reinterpret geographic features, ingest
physics-rate poses, or execute caller code. It renders the geometry declared by
the governed input and preserves the upstream identity and digest.

```text

```

## Initial Scene Sources

One view selects one complete scene layer. A layer is a hierarchical 3D Tiles
dataset, not an object category. Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles therefore
supplies every terrain surface, building, monument, and other textured mesh in
the provider's available coverage through one layer.

The initial source kinds are:

- Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles through its keyed live-session protocol;
- an HTTPS `tileset.json` with relative content;
- a mounted local `tileset.json` for deterministic tests and private data.

The composition contract refers to a configured layer id. It never accepts an
API key. Redirects, credentials, local roots, request caps, and cache behavior
belong to the server-side layer catalog.

`tools/list` refines the generated `create_scene_composition.base_layer`
schema with the exact identifiers from the active catalog. A single configured
layer is also the schema default. Labels and source kinds remain descriptive
catalog fields and are never accepted as identifiers. An unknown identifier
fails with the complete credential-free identifier set and directs the caller
to `view://layers`, which lets a model correct one malformed call without
guessing names.

The first implementation supports explicit 3D Tiles trees, external tilesets,
GLB content, standard glTF materials and textures, and native Draco geometry.
It rejects implicit tiling and legacy `b3dm`, `i3dm`, and `pnts` content with a
typed unsupported-content failure.

## Static Scene Composition

`create_scene_composition` is the only path from a base layer to a view. A
base-only request is valid and produces an immutable composition. The stable
composition identity is UUIDv5-derived from the canonical request digest,
algorithm revision, and complete invocation authority. Repeating the same
request under the same Work Context authority returns the same record.

A composition records its schema version, one base layer, immutable Map
release identities, a style identity, ordered overlays, exact governed inputs,
authority, Work Context, algorithm revision, request digest, and composition
digest. Every governed input carries an exact resource URI, SHA-256 digest,
license, attribution, and an exact media type when bytes are resolved.

Supported overlay geometry is marker, polyline, explicitly triangulated
polygon, oriented GLB mesh instance, and bounded label. Positions are WGS 84
or local metres. Local positions require one Frames binding that names the
world revision, exact frame, affine ECEF transform, and a governed
`frames://operation/...` input. View does not triangulate geographic polygons
or infer a coordinate transform.

Styles contain finite bounded colors and physical dimensions. Visibility is
explicit and can apply minimum or maximum camera distance. An overlay can
carry one timestamp or a validity interval. `capture_frame.scene_time`
determines the visible set.

Inline geometry is limited to 4,096 points and 256 KiB for the complete
overlay declaration. Larger geometry uses the
`application/vnd.veoveo.view-overlay-geometry+json` artifact profile. Each
artifact is limited to 16 MiB, while retained artifact bytes for one
composition are limited to 64 MiB. The server resolves artifact bytes with the
forwarded caller token, validates their declared media type and SHA-256 digest,
and snapshots them into the recoverable capture task. No composition accepts
executable content, credentials, arbitrary URLs, or an ungoverned mesh.

## Camera Contract

An exact geodetic pose is the canonical camera state. Target-based rigs are
input conveniences that resolve to the same pose before selection or capture.

```text
CameraDefinition
  pose
    WGS84 position + heading/pitch/roll + vertical FOV
  look_at
    WGS84 eye + WGS84 target + vertical FOV
  orbit_target
    WGS84 target + distance + azimuth + elevation + vertical FOV
```

Heading is clockwise from true north. Pitch is positive above the local
horizon. Roll uses the right-hand rule around the forward axis. Heights are
WGS84 ellipsoidal metres.

Geodetic and ECEF calculations remain `f64`. Each capture establishes a local
east-up-north frame near its camera rig, composes ECEF transforms in `f64`, and
only then casts local transforms to Bevy `f32`:

```text
+X east
+Y up
-Z north
```

Every frame records the resolved exact pose, configured layer identity,
viewport, and achieved detail.

## Views And Concurrency

A view is principal and Work Context scoped logical state, not a Bevy window
or renderer process. It binds one immutable composition and survives an MCP
transport reconnect until explicit close. Camera replacement uses an expected
revision. A capture snapshots one camera revision, the resolved composition,
exact artifact bytes, and one scene time. Later camera or external artifact
changes cannot alter a queued or recovered capture.

Views sharing a configured layer share its root session, flattened tree, raw
bytes, CPU tile content, and Bevy assets. They retain independent cameras,
local origins, and frame results.

Network fetch and CPU decode work run concurrently within a render cut.
Same-layer selection and cache mutation are serialized, which prevents
duplicate source requests. GPU submissions pass through a bounded capture
pool before the single externally driven Bevy renderer.

## MCP Surface

### Tools

| Tool | Invocation | Required scope | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_scene_composition` | direct | `view:write` | immutable governed composition |
| `create_view` | direct | `view:write` | owner-scoped view and initial revision |
| `set_camera` | direct | `view:write` | replaced camera and next revision |
| `capture_frame` | task only | `view:capture` | image content and captured-frame metadata |
| `close_view` | direct | `view:write` | closed view identity |

`capture_frame` accepts an explicit scene time, physical pixel dimensions, a
maximum screen-space error, a deadline, and a typed deadline behavior.
Returning the best available frame reports whether the requested detail was
reached. Metadata contains the composition identity and digest, every governed
input, camera revision, capture and scene timestamps, style identity, Frames
revision when present, truncation and detail state, attribution, and output
SHA-256 digest.

### Resources

Root resources are:

```text
view://layers
view://compositions
view://views
view://frames
```

Resource templates are:

```text
view://layer/{layer_id}
view://composition/{composition_id}
view://view/{view_id}
view://frame/{frame_id}
view://view/{view_id}/scene{?width_px,height_px,max_screen_error_px}
view://tile/{tile_key}
```

Compositions, views, and frames are principal and Work Context scoped.
Composition records are immutable. Resource lists are paginated. The server
emits list-change notifications after composition or view creation and close,
root-resource updates after captures, and view-resource updates after camera
replacement.

Completion applies to visible view ids, frame ids, and configured layer ids.
No prompt belongs in the initial capture-only domain.

### Preview App

`ui://view/preview.html` is a self-contained MCP App (gated on `view:capture`
like the capture surface it drives) that exercises the real tool lifecycle:
`create_scene_composition`, `create_view`, `set_camera` under revision control, task-based
`capture_frame` through the host's task proxy, and `close_view` on teardown.
It never gets parallel convenience tools. The document is composed at serve
time from `assets/preview-app.template.html` plus the vendored three.js/draco
bundle in `assets/vendor/` (rebuilt via `tools/vendor-three/`); guard tests
pin self-containment and the console host's 2 MiB document cap.

When the host opens the App for a `create_scene_composition` result, the App
hydrates that immutable composition, reports it as ready, and reuses it for the
next `create_view` call while its selected layer remains unchanged. A
`create_view` result hydrates the complete camera view and loads its scene.
Tool failures remain visible inline and never masquerade as an empty scene.

The app's in-browser 3D scene reads the parameterized view-scene resource
(owner-scoped, `view:read`). Its typed viewport and screen-space error policy
drives the same frustum selection used for capture, and the transport admits a
complete render cut of up to 256 tiles. The app sends its current capture policy,
which keeps detail inside the camera frustum representative of the requested
frame. The manifest carries the
resolved camera, a local origin with its column-major `local_from_ecef`
frame, aggregated attribution, and per-tile `view://tile/{tile_key}` URIs
with verbatim `ecef_from_content` transforms (glTF Y-up to Z-up baked in;
CESIUM_RTC and node transforms stay inside the GLB and are the consumer's
job, exactly as in the renderer). Tile keys are sha256 tokens over the layer
and credential-free content location, resolved through an in-process
FIFO-bounded registry — like frames, they do not survive process restarts,
and a stale token fails with guidance to re-read the scene. Tile reads serve
raw draco GLB bytes from the source byte cache (refetch on miss under the
source's own credential and host rules) and refuse tiles above 1.5 MB so
base64 blobs stay under the console host's 2 MiB read cap.

## Tile Selection

The renderer flattens explicit tile trees while retaining parent links,
refinement mode, cumulative transforms, bounding volumes, geometric error, and
content identity. Selection uses physical-pixel screen-space error:

```text
SSE = geometric_error * focal_length_in_physical_pixels
      / distance_to_bounding_volume
```

Traversal applies frustum culling, `REPLACE` and `ADD` refinement, coarse
ancestor fallback, and prioritized loading. Its distance floor uses the camera
height above the ellipsoid, which prevents tall coarse globe volumes from
forcing inappropriate street-level refinement. The effective SSE threshold
relaxes beyond the configured 2 km detail falloff, measured from camera height,
and keeps the near target at the requested quality while bounding horizon work.

Frame history protects the render cut in both zoom directions. Load order is
urgent coverage, refinement descent, normal cut content, then ancestor preload;
distance within each tier is weighted toward the camera axis. A capture is
complete when every visible branch has settled at its available provider detail.
A deadline can return the best available covered cut instead.

The implementation does not depend on `bevy_3d_tiles`. Its pure traversal math
and test scenarios are useful behavioral references. Its Bevy 0.18 ECS
scheduler, render-coupled decode types, native worker-per-request model, and
native Draco limitation are not inherited.

## Cache And Residency

Caching is part of correctness and cost control, not a later optimization.
Each configured layer has four reuse levels:

1. provider session and root tileset;
2. raw HTTP response bytes;
3. decoded CPU meshes, materials, and images;
4. Bevy GPU meshes, textures, and materials.

The initial implementation intentionally has no persistent disk cache. Raw
HTTP keys use canonical qualified content identities with credentials removed.
Decoded and GPU keys add the content hash, preventing stale GPU reuse after a
source object changes.

Raw, decoded, and GPU limits are independent byte budgets. An active render
holds its selected content through reference-counted snapshots. Each cache
evicts its least recently used unpinned entries when its own byte budget is
crossed.

HTTP freshness follows `Cache-Control` and `ETag`. Stale entries revalidate;
`no-store` remains transient. The Google adapter keeps its current provider
session and in-process residency, and applies the response directives instead
of inventing an unconditional lifetime.

## Native Decode Boundary

Fetch produces immutable content bytes. CPU decode produces renderer-neutral
meshes, images, materials, node transforms, ECEF offsets, and attribution.
Only the renderer adapter creates Bevy assets.

Native Draco decoding uses the current pure-Rust `draco-core` implementation
through `draco-gltf`. GLB preprocessing preserves planetary translations in
`f64` before glTF's local `f32` transforms are read. The decoder never creates
Bevy `Mesh`, `Image`, or material values.

## Bevy Renderer

The service uses Bevy 0.19 with an exact dependency and a minimal feature set.
It has no Winit plugin, primary window, OS input source, camera controller,
audio stack, UI, or picking backend. An externally driven `App` renders into
`Image` targets and pumps only for asset upload, capture, readback, and cleanup
work.

Production selects the Vulkan backend, high-performance power preference, and
rejects fallback or CPU adapters. Readiness includes the selected adapter name,
backend, and device type. A process without a hardware adapter is not ready.

The NVIDIA image contains the Vulkan loader and runs through NVIDIA Container
Toolkit with `graphics`, `compute`, and `utility` driver capabilities. Helm
requests one `nvidia.com/gpu` resource for each renderer replica.

## Attribution

Each decoded glTF can carry `asset.copyright`. Governed composition inputs
carry required attribution. A captured render cut collects, sorts, and
deduplicates both sources into an `AttributionSet`. The frame result returns
that set for display beside the image.

## Limits And Failure

Configuration bounds compositions per owner and globally, active views,
captures in flight, tile load concurrency, response bytes, tree nodes,
viewport dimensions, overlay counts and geometry, retained artifact bytes,
frame retention, cache bytes, and Google source requests. Limits fail closed
with typed MCP errors.

Closing a view cancels unfinished captures for that view. Renderer startup
fails before readiness when Vulkan selects a CPU, fallback, or non-NVIDIA
adapter in the production profile.

## Deployment And Verification

The Kubernetes Service exposes health and MCP ports only inside the cluster. The
gateway is the normal caller and forwards signed internal identity. The
container runs as the non-root Veoveo user with a read-only root filesystem and
writable `/tmp`.

Rust tests cover camera resolution, ECEF cancellation, tree construction, SSE
selection, weighted eviction, freshness, credential-free cache keys, GLB
preprocessing, and typed unsupported content. The Rust smoke path starts the
renderer inside the NVIDIA container, verifies a non-CPU Vulkan adapter,
captures a deterministic local tileset and governed marker, polyline, polygon,
and label overlays through source, traversal, decode, and Bevy through the
production MCP task and frame-resource boundaries. It verifies composition
provenance, output digest, and owner isolation. The production image
contains only the View MCP server. Build it with `cargo xtask image build
--target view-mcp`, then dispatch the Rust harness with `cargo xtask smoke
view-mcp`.

The billed live acceptance scenario captures Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles
from a camera orbiting the Statue of Liberty at 40.6892494, -74.0445004. It
requires the API key in `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, passes the variable by name
rather than putting its value in the command line, drives the production MCP
task interface, requires an NVIDIA adapter, and retains only the rendered JPEG:

```sh
cargo xtask image build --target view-mcp
cargo xtask smoke view-google-live \
  --output /tmp/veoveo-view-proof/statue-of-liberty.jpg
```
