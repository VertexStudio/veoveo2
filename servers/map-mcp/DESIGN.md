# Map MCP Design

This document is the canonical design and operational contract for the
`map-mcp` crate.

`map-mcp` is Veoveo's Earth geography and logistics-routing domain. Agents use
one strongly typed MCP surface to find places, inspect facilities and borders,
work with coordinates, apply transport restrictions, calculate routes, build
matrices, publish cuOpt-ready travel models, inspect reachable areas, and
author governed feature layers. Source administration runs through the same
MCP surface: scoped tools for mutations, `map://` resources for reads, and one
permission-aware MCP App that renders immutable compositions
(see `mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md`).

Map MCP is also a reusable capability for other MCP servers. Consumers use the
canonical `map://` resources and Map tools through the gateway, or declare a
typed App dependency when their own App needs Map data. They do not connect to
Map storage, private HTTP routes, or renderer internals. The installation's
profile, policy, scopes, tenant, labels, and Work Context remain authoritative
for every consumer.

## Status

Implemented in this workspace.

The implementation includes the Map domain contract, SurrealDB records,
tenant-scoped DuckDB Spatial tables, a supervised Valhalla land engine, a
governed network planner, source acquisition, release activation, MCP discovery
surfaces, administrative MCP tools, the Map workspace MCP App, gateway
proxying, Helm, offline image registration, governed spatial and raster
derivations, and the immutable travel-model handoff to Optimization MCP.

The canonical service identity is:

```text
crate       veoveo-map-mcp
folder      servers/map-mcp
slug        map
URI scheme  map
MCP         /map/mcp
workspace   ui://map/workspace.html
health      /map/healthz
```

Gateway-mounted tools use names such as `map__route`. Resource identities keep
the `map://` scheme.

## Standards And Protocols

| Standard or protocol | Implemented profile |
|---|---|
| [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) | JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP with tools, resources and templates, prompts, completions, subscriptions, notifications, and typed structured content. |
| MCP Tasks extension `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` | Version `2026-07-28`; acquisition, routing, import, export, publication, and vector-product operations use durable task semantics where declared. |
| [MCP Apps SEP-1865](../../mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md) | `ext-apps` version `2026-01-26`; `ui://map/workspace.html` uses the sandboxed host bridge and canonical Map tools and resources. |
| [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/) | MCP schemas and immutable authored-layer property contracts. Layer schemas reject remote references. |
| WGS 84 and EPSG identifiers | Longitude, latitude, and ellipsoidal height are the geographic exchange. PROJ handles bounded projected-CRS conversion; EPSG:4978 and vertical transformations are outside that 2D operation. |
| DuckDB 1.5.5 and DuckDB Spatial | Map selects `geometry_always_xy = true`, constructs longitude/latitude as `POINT_2D`, and uses one materialized spherical-distance score per candidate. |
| [GeoJSON RFC 7946](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.html), OGC JSON-FG 1.0, and [GeoJSON Text Sequences RFC 8142](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8142.html) | Canonical feature geometry, semantic feature types, valid time, bulk import, and immutable export. |
| [OGC GeoPackage 1.4](https://www.geopackage.org/spec140/) | Bounded vector-table inspection, selected-table import, and one-table export. Raster tiles, related tables, and non-linear or measured geometry are outside this profile. GDAL 3.13.3 performs full conformance validation and controlled conversion. |
| OGC CQL2 1.0 | Bounded Basic CQL2-JSON predicates over top-level authored properties. Arbitrary CQL2 and spatial predicates are not claimed. |
| GeoParquet 1.0.0 | WKB primary geometry and verified `geo` metadata for immutable analytical products. |
| OGC Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF 1.0 and GeoTIFF 1.1 | Environmental sources normalize to immutable COG products with explicit CRS, affine transform, extent, resolution, bands, units, nodata values, value interpretation, checksum, license, and attribution. |
| Veoveo spatial derivation profile `map-spatial-local-equirectangular-wgs84-v1` | Advisory operations use a WGS84 local equirectangular plane with the exact 6,371,008.8 m mean Earth radius. Each operation is bounded to two degrees on either axis and records its origin and algorithm revision. This is a repository-owned profile, not a projected-CRS standard. |
| Mapbox Vector Tile 2.1, MapLibre Style 8, MapLibre GL JS 6.6.0, and the OpenFreeMap hosted style profile | Deterministic bounded XYZ tile bundles, safe literal presentation styles, a keyless vector basemap, and a self-contained WebGL2 composition viewer. |
| OSM PBF, GTFS Schedule, S-57/S-100, AIXM, and FAA NASR exchange sets | Registered acquisition adapters accept only their documented snapshot profiles. Product-specific operational validation remains explicit. |
| HTTPS and mounted exchange sets | Registered sources control hosts, redirects, media types, credentials, byte limits, elapsed time, and filesystem roots before an adapter runs. |
| Valhalla HTTP/JSON | A supervised loopback-only routing-engine protocol. The travel-model adapter uses one concise many-to-many request per requested vehicle type. It is an internal projection, never a public Map API. |
| `veoveo.io/travel-model-artifact/v1` | Repository-owned immutable exchange from Map to Optimization. It carries shared location order, per-vehicle-type cost and transit-time matrices, unavailable cells, and exact Map resource attestation. |

The workspace pins `geo` 0.32.0 because SurrealDB 3.2 uses the same release
line and requires `i_overlay <4.1`. `geo` 0.33.1 requires `i_overlay >=4.5`,
which Cargo cannot resolve in this workspace. The selected release contains
the signed buffer operation used by the spatial profile.

## Domain Scope

Map answers where something is on Earth and whether a specific mobility
profile can travel there. It provides:

- WGS84 geography, projected CRS transformations, and ellipsoidal geodesics;
- locations, facilities, boundaries, map datasets, and effective restrictions;
- versioned human and vehicle mobility profiles;
- route feasibility, geometry, cost, provenance, matrices, and reachable areas;
- immutable heterogeneous travel models for cuOpt routing;
- advisory spatial geometry and complete-route mobility validation;
- governed source acquisition and immutable release activation;
- Work Context-owned GeoJSON and JSON-FG feature authoring, revision, query,
  tombstone, restore, and publication;
- map-owned analytical and routing-engine projections.

Optimization consumes attested Map travel models to compose fleet selection,
assignments, schedules, stop sequences, and multi-asset transfers.
Map embeds the hardened DuckDB runtime as a library and owns its analytical
database and SQL policy.

## Architecture

```

The Rust server is PID 1. Valhalla listens only on loopback and is supervised by
the server. The Python acquisition application is invoked as a bounded child
process. These components ship in one image and share one persistent Map
volume.

## Canonical Map Families

The contract has seven map families.

| Map family | Meaning | Runtime use |
|---|---|---|
| `road_street` | motor-road network | Valhalla road routing |
| `active_mobility` | walking, hiking, cycling, and accessibility paths | Valhalla human routing |
| `rail_transit` | governed rail network | explicit network edges |
| `off_road_terrain` | traversable terrain and off-road corridors | explicit network edges |
| `maritime` | surface and subsurface corridors | explicit network edges |
| `aviation` | air corridors and operational routes | explicit network edges |
| `intermodal` | terminals and transfer relationships | facility and transfer metadata |

Shared layers include names, facilities, administrative borders, hazards,
restrictions, elevation, bathymetry, weather, tides, currents, and traffic.
They constrain one or more families rather than becoming separate route
engines.

Intermodal is a first-class compatibility and transfer family. A single
`route` request still uses one mobility profile. Multi-asset transfer selection
is assembled from Map legs by Optimization.

## Mobility Profiles

The canonical `MobilityProfile` has one human family and eight vehicle
families. Versioned profile instances carry actual dimensions, performance,
energy, permissions, validity, and operational constraints.

| Family | Initial controlled modes or classes |
|---|---|
| Human | walk, run, hike, manual mobility aid, powered mobility aid |
| Road vehicle | bicycle, powered two-wheeler, passenger car, light commercial, rigid truck, articulated truck, bus or coach, emergency service |
| Off-road vehicle | wheeled, tracked, ATV or UTV, heavy equipment, uncrewed ground vehicle |
| Rail vehicle | light rail or metro, passenger train, freight train, maintenance train |
| Surface vessel | small craft, cargo, tanker, passenger ferry, tug or workboat, fishing or service, uncrewed surface vessel |
| Subsurface vessel | submarine, autonomous underwater vehicle, remotely operated vehicle, underwater glider |
| Fixed wing | light, regional transport, heavy cargo, amphibious |
| Rotorcraft | helicopter, heavy-lift helicopter, tiltrotor |
| UAS | multirotor, fixed wing, hybrid VTOL |

This gives 9 profile families and 43 initial controlled class or movement
values. The number of profile instances is unbounded. A deployment can create
separate versions for its people, cars, trucks, ships, aircraft, accessibility
needs, and mission rules without changing the enum.

Profile fields remain specific to the domain. Examples include axle loads and
hazardous cargo for road vehicles, ground pressure and water depth for off-road
vehicles, gauge and electrification for rail, draft and under-keel clearance
for vessels, and runway, ceiling, reserve, navigation, and airspace permissions
for aircraft.

Every family also carries one `MobilityPlanningEnvelope`. It sets the minimum
speed, optional minimum turn radius, climb and descent bounds, lateral and
vertical clearance, optional ceiling and range, route-point and segment limits,
allowed terrain classes, and allowed restriction kinds. A family-specific
physical range or aircraft service ceiling remains authoritative when it is
more restrictive than the common envelope.

## Coordinate Contract

WGS84 longitude and latitude are the canonical route exchange. Optional height
is ellipsoidal unless a contract states otherwise.

Map provides bounded two-dimensional CRS transformation through PROJ. It
rejects geocentric EPSG:4978 and vertical values instead of silently copying
or mis-transforming them. GeographicLib supplies WGS84 direct and inverse
geodesics. Geofence validation checks segment geometry, not only vertices.

The shared `mcp/contract/src/coordinates.rs` types keep WGS84 exchange
consistent across Veoveo services.

## Persistence

SurrealDB is the canonical operational catalog. It stores:

- registered sources and immutable dataset-release records;
- active release pointers and optimistic record versions;
- mobility profiles and effective restrictions;
- operational snapshots, routes, dependencies, and matrices;
- acquisition jobs and durable task state;
- authored feature layers, schema and style revisions, feature revisions and
  heads, atomic changesets, and immutable layer publications;
- immutable publication products, map composition heads, and composition
  revisions.

DuckDB Spatial is the local analytical projection. The service opens one
configured database instance for its lifetime and clones connections inside
that instance for concurrent work. Read paths begin explicit read-only
transactions. Task exports receive only a validated direct child of the
installation-owned task root, while the database and spill directory remain
outside that file surface. Its schema is tenant keyed
and contains active-release pointers, locations, facilities, boundaries,
governed network edges, authored feature revision and head projections, and
Work Context-scoped raster and spatial derivations.
Spatial queries use `ST_Contains`, `ST_Intersects`, and `ST_Distance_Sphere`.
The Spatial extension is copied into the image at build time and loaded only
from its pinned local path. Map selects the shared runtime's closed
`GeoJsonLongitudeLatitude` axis policy before configuration is locked. Startup and
health read `current_setting('geometry_always_xy')` and require `true`.

Selective geometry reads use the existing DuckDB Spatial R-tree indexes on
boundaries, immutable source features, authored revisions, and authored heads.
The schema 9 to 10 upgrade drops and recreates those four derived indexes before any
index is bound. It preserves every base-table row, advances the schema marker in the
replacement transaction only after all indexes exist, and then eagerly verifies each
index. An interruption leaves schema 9 in place, making the replacement sequence
repeatable at the next startup.
Other obsolete schema markers fail closed with an explicit projection-rebuild error.
The query shape first obtains geometry-only candidates from the indexed base
table. Tenant, Work Context, release, layer, revision, and exact spatial
predicates remain on the authoritative outer query. This separation prevents
non-spatial selectivity estimates from hiding the R-tree from DuckDB's planner.
Dateline-crossing boxes use two candidate branches joined by `UNION`, because
an `OR` between spatial predicates does not produce two R-tree scans.

`src/authoring/query/performance.rs` is the executable performance contract for
feature-layer viewport reads. It loads 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 indexed
features under the production 1 GiB memory and four-thread settings. Every
scale must expose `RTREE_INDEX_SCAN` in the production query plan and match an
independent numeric point oracle. The same gate covers dateline branches,
publication revision selection, moved features, delete and reinsert index
maintenance, R-tree leaf cardinality, and database size. On the test host,
selective reads must remain below two seconds cold and 250 ms warm p95. Indexed
fixture loading must sustain 5,000 rows per second and the million-feature
database must remain below 2 GiB. These generous regression ceilings are local
acceptance budgets, not service latency claims.

Release-product projection is attempt scoped. Each preparation receives a
private UUIDv7 attempt and writes complete source features in transactions of
at most 256 features or 32 MiB of canonical source-feature data. Stable logical
ids remain unchanged across releases. Stored rows add the tenant, immutable
release, attempt, and contiguous ordinal needed to keep simultaneous releases
and interrupted retries distinct.

The completion ledger is the visibility boundary. Its final transaction checks
the row count, distinct ordinal count, ordinal range, and logical-id uniqueness
for every high-volume release table. It also checks the raster count. Only the
winning attempt becomes readable or activatable. An interrupted attempt may
remain on disk, but its rows cannot enter tools, resources, routing, or spatial
queries. A release retains at most eight attempts before preparation stops with
an instruction to rebuild this derived projection. The supported deployment
uses one Map replica and one release writer.

Source tags stay in the immutable feature JSON. Equality predicates match only
JSON strings, while existence predicates include a present JSON null. JSON
Pointer escaping protects tag keys containing `/` or `~`. This avoids the
write amplification of an exploded tag table without weakening release and
attempt isolation.

Schema version 9 is a hard cut. Map refuses to open an older analytical schema
or managed tables without a valid marker. During upgrade, preserve SurrealDB,
the artifact plane, and retained release products, then rebuild only the local
DuckDB projection and replay the retained products before activation. No source
reacquisition or compatibility migration is part of this contract.

The artifact plane stores immutable raw source bytes, normalized products,
routing builds, quality reports, and large task outputs. Cross-server artifact
identity remains `artifact://{artifact_id}`. Map projects those artifacts as
`map://artifact/{artifact_id}` only after applying the normal artifact policy.

## Authored Feature Layers

An authored layer is a governed operational dataset inside one Work Context. The
gateway resolves its business owner, initial grants, classification, labels,
membership, policy revision, and invocation provenance. Map stamps that authority
on the canonical layer and every changeset instead of accepting authority fields
from a tool request.

Feature geometry uses WGS84 GeoJSON coordinates. The complete canonical feature
remains a valid GeoJSON Feature and adds JSON-FG `featureType`, the required
JSON-FG conformance declarations, and valid-time intervals whose open bound is
`..`. Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, and MultiPolygon
are implemented. Validators reject non-finite or out-of-range coordinates,
malformed topology, incorrect polygon winding, unbounded property payloads,
remote JSON Schema references, and unsafe style expressions.

### Object Model

The model separates mutable working state from immutable history and delivery
artifacts.

| Object | Mutability | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| feature layer | optimistic mutable head | Work Context authority, content class, title, current schema/style, and current layer revision |
| schema revision | immutable | JSON Schema 2020-12 property contract used by a range of layer revisions |
| style revision | immutable | bounded literal styling rules used by a range of layer revisions |
| feature revision | immutable | one complete canonical feature or tombstone at one layer revision |
| feature head | optimistic mutable pointer | current revision and deletion state for one feature |
| changeset | immutable and idempotent | one atomic commit, request digest, actor, authority, and projection event sequence |
| publication | immutable | layer, schema, style, and layer-revision pin for stable reads |
| layer product | immutable | exported artifact identity, format, digest, byte count, and publication provenance |
| composition revision | immutable | ordered publication pins, visibility, opacity, and initial camera view |
| composition head | optimistic mutable pointer | current composition revision and archival state |
| durable task | mutable lifecycle record | owner-scoped bulk import, export, or vector-tile execution and recovery |

Layer content classes are `reference`, `named_locations`, `facilities`,
`boundaries`, and `network_candidate`. They express user intent. They do not
grant authority to alter the routing data plane.

### Storage Authority And Projection

SurrealDB owns the immutable truth. A direct commit contains at most 100
mutations and 1 MiB. One transaction checks the expected layer revision and
each expected feature revision, creates feature revisions, advances heads,
records the scoped idempotent changeset, and appends the outbox event. The
changeset stores the event sequence needed for read-your-write projection
checks. A repeated idempotency key returns the original changeset only when its
request digest matches.

DuckDB Spatial is a rebuildable query projection. Its outbox consumer writes a
revision table, a current-head table, R-tree indexes, and a local contiguous
checkpoint in one transaction. Queries can select a current layer or a published
layer revision. They accept a validated WGS84 bounding box, open valid-time
interval, geometry type, opaque keyset cursor, and a bounded Basic CQL2-JSON subset.
Property paths and literal values remain parameters. A dateline-crossing box is
split into two query polygons.

Map eagerly binds and inspects every persisted R-tree during startup before accepting
projection writes. Projection writes then use ordinary `INSERT` statements after
deterministic replay checks. They do not use DuckDB conflict-merge insertion against
R-tree tables, because lazy index binding can replay non-flat Spatial vectors when one
transaction mixes point, line, and polygon geometries. Duplicate projected identities
fail the transaction. The pinned Spatial regression test reopens the database, commits
all three geometry families together, inspects both authored R-tree leaf sets, and
executes an indexed intersection before acceptance.

The artifact plane stores bulk input bytes and immutable output products. The
task root stages a verified import under its parsed task identity. It survives
process restart and is deleted after a terminal task state. Export tasks receive
one task-bound write capability at submission. Durable task requests persist
the verified internal identity and capability, never the caller bearer or an
artifact download URL.

### Standards Profile

The authoring contract pins dated standards. A later upstream revision does not
silently change an existing layer or product contract.

| Standard | Implemented profile |
|---|---|
| [GeoJSON, RFC 7946](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.html) | WGS84 input geometry, FeatureCollection import, feature output |
| [OGC JSON-FG 1.0, OGC 21-045r1](https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-045r1/21-045r1.html) | Core and Feature Types and Schemas conformance declarations, `featureType`, valid-time interval |
| [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core) | local property schemas; remote references are rejected |
| [OGC CQL2 1.0, OGC 21-065r2](https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-065r2/21-065r2.html) | bounded Basic CQL2-JSON equality, ordering, null, boolean, and logical predicates over top-level properties |
| [GeoJSON Text Sequences, RFC 8142](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8142.html) | record-separator and LF-framed import/export |
| [OGC GeoPackage 1.4](https://www.geopackage.org/spec140/) | full validation and bounded vector-table inspection through pinned GDAL 3.13.3; explicit table and metadata-column mappings on import; one two-dimensional WGS84 vector table with an R-tree on export |
| [GeoParquet 1.0.0](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet/blob/v1.0.0/format-specs/geoparquet.md) | WKB primary geometry and GeoParquet metadata emitted by pinned DuckDB Spatial |
| [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification 2.1](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) | requested XYZ tiles with canonical feature identity retained as an attribute |
| [MapLibre Style Specification 8](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/) and MapLibre GL JS 6.6.0 | vector source plus safe literal point, line, polygon, label, opacity, and zoom projections; self-contained WebGL2 workspace viewing |
| [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/quick_start/) hosted MapLibre Style profile | Credential-free MapLibre Style 8 URLs supply vector geographic context for both Console themes. The defaults are OpenFreeMap Positron for light mode and OpenFreeMap Dark for dark mode. Map MCP validates both URLs, requires one exact HTTPS origin, and declares that origin in MCP App CSP metadata. The supported profile requires both style documents, sprites, glyphs, TileJSON, and tiles to remain on that origin; an installation may replace the pair with controlled or self-hosted styles that preserve this boundary. This is a basemap presentation profile, not complete conformance to an external tile-service API. |

The image pins [DuckDB Spatial](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/spatial/overview)
to DuckDB 1.5.5. Export verification rejects a generated Parquet file unless
its `geo` metadata declares version `1.0.0`, names `geometry` as the primary
column, and identifies its encoding as `WKB`. GeoParquet 2.0 is not claimed.
A future 2.0 path requires an encoder and verifier that both implement its
Parquet geometry logical type.

### Editing, Transfer, And Publication

The public MCP surface includes create, update, validate, commit, query, restore,
publish, and archive tools. Layer heads, schema revisions, style revisions by
layer version or stable style identity,
feature queries, feature heads and revisions, changesets, and publications are
URI-addressed resources. Mutable heads and indexes support MCP subscriptions and
resource-update notifications. Individual features are never expanded into the
resource list; agents traverse them through the paginated query template.

An import task accepts one authorized GeoJSON FeatureCollection, GeoJSON text
sequence, or GeoPackage artifact. It stages and hashes the bounded input before
task creation, maps external string or numeric identifiers to stable typed feature
ids, and commits at most 10,000 features in one SurrealDB transaction. GeoPackage
import selects one feature table and explicitly maps identity, semantic type,
title, and valid-time columns. The pinned GDAL adapter validates the complete
package, rejects unsupported dimensions and geometry types, converts the declared
CRS to two-dimensional OGC:CRS84, and emits the same canonical RFC 8142 boundary
used by native bulk import. The request supplies a default semantic type when the
source has none. JSON-FG records that declare `featureType` must declare the
supported conformance classes.

`inspect_geopackage` validates an authorized artifact before import and returns a
bounded manifest of feature tables, fields, declared CRS identifiers, extensions,
feature counts, WGS84 extents where safely available, and R-tree declarations.
The manifest does not grant access to the underlying artifact and never selects a
table implicitly.

An immutable publication is the only input to export and presentation. Export
tasks produce GeoJSON text sequence, GeoParquet 1.0, or GeoPackage 1.4. A
GeoPackage product contains one explicitly named WGS84 feature table and its
standard R-tree spatial index. Canonical feature metadata uses reserved
`veoveo_*` fields. Top-level properties use `property:` columns with OGR scalar
or JSON subtypes, which preserves their types across Map export and re-import.
A vector task accepts at
most 512 distinct XYZ coordinates through zoom 22 and emits a deterministic tar
bundle containing MVT 2.1 tiles, a manifest, and a MapLibre Style 8 document.
Every product retains the publication, layer revision, digest, size, format,
artifact identity, creator, and Work Context authority.

A map composition orders at most 64 authored layers and pins one immutable
publication for each layer. Every change appends a composition revision with a
bounded WGS84 view and literal opacity and visibility settings. The mutable head,
immutable revisions, root indexes, completions, and update subscriptions are MCP
resources. A composition is the stable handoff to map presentation clients.

The workspace app at `ui://map/workspace.html` uses the MCP Apps bridge. It
reads `map://workspace` first and exposes only the dataset, administration,
feature-read, feature-write, and publication controls admitted for the caller.
The map remains visible while the user discovers layers, previews records,
inspects a feature, authors geometry, imports an artifact, acquires a source, or
saves a composition. Authoring and administration live in contextual drawers
instead of replacing the map with unrelated forms.

The left catalog presents authored layers and active governed source releases
through one visibility model. Authored layers render their current heads by
default; selecting a saved composition switches them to its exact publication
and style-revision pins. Active source releases render through
`query_source_features`. The bottom preview is a bounded table synchronized
with the visible map, and the right inspector follows the selected catalog item
or feature. A map or table selection highlights the same feature in both
places. Raw JSON is an advanced diagnostic view, never the primary workflow.

MapLibre GL JS 6.6.0 is bundled into the self-contained App with a classic
worker emitted from the same pinned source. The opaque-origin sandbox admits
the worker through its `connect-src data:` and `worker-src blob:` boundaries.
Map MCP supplies one validated basemap descriptor with credential-free light
and dark MapLibre Style URLs and declares their shared exact HTTPS resource
origin to the host. The workspace follows the initial host theme and reacts to
host-context changes without losing its camera, governed overlays, selection,
or bounded preview. The style profile keeps both documents, sprites, glyphs,
TileJSON, and tiles on that origin, while governed feature bytes continue to
cross only the MCP bridge. Basemap failure leaves governed layers usable and
reports the degraded context locally without taking down the workspace.

Each enabled authored layer issues R-tree-backed, viewport-bounded
`query_features` calls in pages of 1,000 and stops at 5,000 features per layer
and viewport. Each enabled active release issues DuckDB Spatial R-tree-backed
`query_source_features` calls in pages of 500 and stops at 5,000 features per
release and viewport. Generation cancellation prevents stale responses from
painting after a camera or visibility change. The visible cap is reported
instead of silently dropping the condition. The UI reports a successful
refresh only after MapLibre reaches an idle paint with returned geometry
visible. Resource subscriptions wake the App to reread canonical state.

The Add data workflow distinguishes three actions. Create layer uses ordinary
fields with a permissive JSON Schema default. Add feature uses map drawing,
title, semantic type, and a property editor. Import artifact accepts an
authorized artifact id and explicit GeoJSON FeatureCollection, RFC 8142, or
GeoPackage settings; GeoPackage inspection runs first and the user selects one
reported feature table. Task-only imports use the MCP Tasks lifecycle inside
the App. Source acquisition chooses a governed source and draws its WGS84
extent on the persistent map. Canonical source, schema, profile, and request
JSON remain available under an Advanced disclosure for operators who need the
complete typed contract.

The map fails closed unless WebGL2 creation succeeds with the major-performance
caveat check, the debug renderer extension identifies the adapter, and the
renderer fingerprint is not a known software path. Browser acceptance must
prove the same condition in a headed browser. The App is a two-dimensional
feature and source-release workspace. It does not provide raster presentation,
3D geometry authoring, collaborative geometry editing, or server-side
rendering.

### Deliberate Boundaries

`reference`, `named_locations`, `facilities`, `boundaries`, and
`network_candidate` are authoring classifications, not routing authority. A
generic feature commit or publication never changes an active source release or
Valhalla data. Routing influence requires a separate governed validation and
release-promotion operation.

The implementation does not provide arbitrary CQL2, spatial CQL2 predicates,
GeoParquet 2.0, mutable raster authoring, 3D authoring, an OGC API Features
HTTP service, collaborative locks or CRDTs, or automatic promotion of a
`network_candidate`.
These are new contracts, not compatibility details, and must be added through
their owning components.

Artifact write capabilities expire after 24 hours by artifact-plane policy. An
output task that cannot redeem its submission-time capability within that
window fails closed on recovery. It never refreshes authority through a stored
caller bearer.

The next implementation phase should add a validated network-candidate promotion
task, a true GeoParquet 2.0 encoder, streaming artifact ingest for datasets above
the transactional import bound, and schema migration tasks. Property flattening and packaged
tile pyramids belong in the vector product path when client requirements justify
their storage cost.

## Authoritative Data Acquisition

A map release records one governed occurrence of source bytes. Every registered
source declares authority, coverage, map families, acquisition model, location,
media types, limits, license, and credential references.

Authority is evaluated per fact and region. An official bridge-clearance source
can supersede a community road tag while the same community release continues
to supply nearby road geometry. Publisher responsibility and validity determine
precedence alongside time.

### Recommended Sources By Domain

| Domain | Practical baseline | Higher-authority additions |
|---|---|---|
| roads, paths, names, places | regional OpenStreetMap PBF | transport departments, municipalities, bridge and tunnel operators, border and customs authorities |
| rail and public transport | OSM geometry and GTFS Schedule | infrastructure managers, timetable publishers, station and terminal operators |
| borders and jurisdictions | OSM for general context | responsible cadastral, statistical, customs, maritime-limit, or civil-aviation authority |
| maritime | licensed S-57 ENC during transition | hydrographic-office S-100 products, port and navigation authorities |
| aviation | authority exchange sets | AIS or ANSP AIXM, effective AIRAC releases, FAA NASR where applicable |
| facilities | OSM discovery | port, airport, depot, warehouse, fueling, charging, and terminal operators |
| terrain and conditions | installation-selected environmental source | responsible weather, hydrology, ocean, terrain, and traffic authority |

OpenStreetMap supplies the global baseline. Operations that depend on legal
borders, clearances, navigational charts, airspace, or effective restrictions
select the responsible publisher for those facts.

### Registered Source Contract

`RegisteredSource` controls acquisition before any network or file operation.

`SourceLocation` is a tagged enum:

- `https` contains one HTTPS endpoint and explicit redirect hosts;
- `osm_replication` records a snapshot endpoint and replication endpoint;
- `mounted_exchange_set` contains a controlled mount id and relative path.

The current acquisition worker processes snapshots. An `osm_replication`
location acquires its registered snapshot and retains the replication endpoint
as source metadata. The contract classifies sequenced deltas, effective-event
feeds, and observation streams as operational feeds governed by continuity,
update-chain, and expiry rules.

### Network And File Controls

The Rust process resolves every input from a registered source before invoking
the helper.

HTTPS acquisition enforces:

- HTTPS endpoints without embedded credentials or fragments;
- registered endpoint and redirect-host allowlists;
- public resolved addresses, including every redirect target;
- bounded redirect count, response bytes, and one absolute elapsed deadline;
- registered response media types;
- controlled bearer or `x-*` credential headers loaded from secret files;
- direct connections governed by the registered host policy.

Mounted inputs are canonicalized beneath the installation exchange root and
must be regular files. Job workspaces are unique. Paths returned by the helper
must remain inside the job output directory.

### Same-Container Acquisition Application

The Python package lives under `servers/map-mcp/data/` and is locked by
`uv.lock`. Rust writes one typed JSON command to stdin and accepts one typed
JSON result from stdout. The helper uses argument arrays without a shell,
bounds diagnostic output, applies a wall-clock limit, and terminates its whole
process group on timeout or cancellation.

The image includes:

- GDAL and `ogr2ogr` for vector normalization;
- Osmium for OSM PBF validation;
- Valhalla graph-building utilities;
- Python only for controlled source-tool orchestration;
- the pinned DuckDB Spatial extension for the Rust runtime.

The image installs every package and the pinned DuckDB Spatial extension during
its build.

### Adapter Availability

| Adapter kind | Current snapshot behavior |
|---|---|
| `open_street_map` | checks PBF references, writes every point, line, multiline, multipolygon, and relation layer plus GeoParquet, then builds and archives Valhalla routing data |
| `authority_vector` | uses GDAL to write GeoParquet and WGS84 GeoJSON |
| `gtfs_schedule` | checks safe ZIP expansion and required files, optionally runs a configured validator, retains a normalized ZIP |
| `environmental` | writes a COG with Zstandard compression and overviews, then records complete typed raster metadata |
| `s57_enc` and `s100` | use the pinned GDAL maritime conversion path to GeoParquet |
| `aixm` and `faa_nasr` | use the pinned GDAL aviation conversion path to GeoParquet |
| `gtfs_realtime` | represented in the contract but rejected by base-release acquisition |

The generic maritime and aviation conversions establish the intake primitive.
Operational reliance adds product-specific S-57 update-chain, S-100 product,
AIXM timeslice, or NASR validation in the corresponding adapter.

GeoJSON and GeoJSON Sequence products feed the analytical projection. Every
normalized point, line, polygon, and relation becomes a complete immutable
source feature before specialized projections run. The governed OSM profile
emits the source element version and every source tag as JSON. A relation
GeometryCollection becomes one feature per bounded leaf geometry. Those
features retain the common relation identity and a deterministic geometry
path.

Each feature retains normalized tags, original names and references, source
element identity and version, source and release digests, geometry digest,
operating-area memberships, license, and attribution. Feature ids derive
stable UUIDv5 Map ids from source identity, element kind, source element
identity, and geometry path. A line-delimited product also includes its stable
product and record position when the source supplies no element identity.

`inspect_position` resolves one WGS84 observation against the active governed
projection in one bounded query per entity class. It returns distance-ordered
named locations and facilities, containing boundaries, the active release
identities used by the projection, and explicit gaps when the governed data
does not label the surrounding area. Callers do not need to enumerate releases
or search raw source features to answer where an observed position is.

`query_source_features` always names one immutable release. It supports source
and element identity, exact tag equality, tag existence, normalized text,
representation, bounding box, intersection, containment, distance, and nearest
predicates. Results use a deterministic identity order, or distance then
identity for distance queries. Spherical distance casts the feature centroid to
`POINT_2D`, constructs query positions with `ST_Point2D(longitude, latitude)`, and
materializes `distance_m` once for limits, cursor comparison, projection, and order.
An opaque cursor binds to the `veoveo.io/map/source-feature-query/v2` digest domain.
The decoder requires distance state to match the selected order and rejects prior
cursor domains.

Environmental acquisition publishes the COG and its metadata sidecar as
separate immutable artifacts. Release activation indexes a `RasterProduct`
whose artifact identity, checksum, source release, CRS, affine transform,
dimensions, extent, resolution, bands, units, nodata values, interpretation,
license, and attribution remain available through Map resources.

`derive_raster` is a durable task for bounded sampling, windows, class masks,
contours, polygonization, skeletonization, and line derivation. A controlled
GDAL helper reads only the already-authorized staged source and writes into
the task directory. The task publishes one governed artifact and records the
source checksum, CRS and affine transform, every operation parameter, the
exact `gdal-3.13.3-veoveo-raster-v1` algorithm revision, output digest,
output CRS and affine transform where applicable, principal, and Work
Context. Sampling and raster products preserve their declared CRS. GeoJSON
derivations are transformed to WGS84 before publication.

The narrower projections remain derived conveniences. Named points become
locations unless `facility_kind` is present. Polygon features become
boundaries. A LineString becomes a governed network edge when it carries
`from_node`, `to_node`, `map_family`, and `nominal_duration_s`; optional fields
include `distance_m` and `bidirectional`.

### Acquisition Jobs

The `start_acquisition` tool accepts a registered source id, a requested
WGS84 bounding box, an idempotency key, and an optional
`expected_source_digest_sha256`. When supplied, the digest is verified against
the downloaded bytes before a release is staged.

Jobs are durable catalog records with queued, running, succeeded, failed,
cancel-requested, and cancelled states. A successful job creates a staged
release, and activation remains an explicit version-guarded operation. After a
server restart, listing jobs marks interrupted work failed; the operator starts
a new idempotent acquisition.

Public failure messages identify the phase without copying helper stderr or
licensed source excerpts. Bounded diagnostics stay in server logs.

## Release Versioning And Activation

`DatasetRelease` contains:

```text
release_id
dataset_id
source_id
version_label
source_digest_sha256
coverage
acquired_at
valid_from
valid_until?
schema_version
normalization_pipeline_version
routing_build_version?
license
raw_artifact_uri
normalized_artifact_uris
quality_report_uri
supersedes_release_id?
state
record_version
```

The current version label is `sha256:{digest}`. The full digest proves byte
identity. A release id identifies the governed occurrence, its validity,
license, normalized products, and policy context. Release states are `staged`,
`active`, `retired`, and `quarantined`.

Routing archives are safely expanded once into the retained release directory.
Archive traversal, links, excessive entry count, and excessive expanded bytes
are rejected. Activation and rollback reuse the retained cached products.

Activation follows this sequence:

1. Validate and ingest retained release products into tenant-scoped DuckDB
   rows that are not yet selected.
2. Atomically update the SurrealDB release state and active dataset pointer
   under expected release and pointer versions.
3. Atomically switch the Valhalla active-directory symlink on Unix and update
   the DuckDB active pointer.
4. Restart the supervised Valhalla process when the release has routing data.
5. Retire the previous release and invalidate routes that depend on it.

The SurrealDB state and pointer share one database transaction and establish the
canonical active release. DuckDB and filesystem projections reconcile after
that catalog commit. A projection failure returns an error while preserving the
canonical release, and calling `activate` again with current record versions
performs an idempotent reconciliation. The admin app exposes this as `Reconcile`.

Map deploys as one replica with one persistent `ReadWriteOnce` volume. The
activation mutex serializes local product switches inside that process.

Licenses travel with each release. The contract records attribution,
redistribution, derivative, offline-bundle, and expiry policy.

## Routing

Every route request names an immutable mobility profile version, endpoints,
departure time, objective, constraints, alternatives, and a data policy.
Endpoints may be WGS84 positions, location ids, or facility ids.

The planner resolves active releases whose source families are compatible with
the profile and whose validity contains the departure time. It captures an
operational snapshot, applies effective restrictions, and persists route
provenance. Missing coverage fails explicitly.

### Land

Human and road-vehicle profiles use the supervised Valhalla engine. The adapter
maps the controlled profile to pedestrian, bicycle, motor-scooter, motorcycle,
auto, truck, or bus costing and validates profile values against the engine's
supported limits. Valhalla produces route geometry, maneuver instructions,
distance, duration, alternatives, and land isochrones.

### Governed Networks

Off-road, rail, surface-vessel, subsurface-vessel, fixed-wing, rotorcraft, and
UAS profiles use explicit activated LineString edges for their map family. The
planner connects each exact endpoint to its nearest governed node within 10 km,
retains those connector segments in the returned geometry, and costs them at
the profile's preferred, nominal, or cruise speed. Before persistence, it densifies
governed edges and exact-endpoint connectors to the profile's maximum segment length.
The exact endpoints remain unchanged, and inserted points interpolate ellipsoidal
height. The planner verifies consistent node geometry, applies avoided areas, and runs
A* for fastest or shortest objectives. It
returns `planning_advisory` until the selected sources and performance models
carry domain-specific certification. Planning requires connected activated
edges, supports fastest and shortest objectives, and accepts explicit avoided
areas. The caller opts into planning-advisory output through its data policy.

### Restrictions And Validation

Effective restrictions target mobility families and carry typed effects,
geometry, authority, and validity. Prohibitions become avoided areas during
planning. Route validation checks every leg against the planning envelope and
active restrictions. Lateral clearance expands the checked route corridor.
Typed dimensional, mass, speed, depth, altitude, and reserve limits resolve
against the selected profile. A missing or incompatible vertical reference
fails closed.

Routes pin base release ids, one operational snapshot id, planner version, cost
model version, restriction ids, facilities, and validation identity. Release
changes and restriction withdrawal invalidate dependent routes while preserving
the original record for review.

Map is also the sole producer of the versioned
`veoveo.io/map-route-handoff/v1` cross-server profile. A handoff is prepared
from one persisted route only after Map rejects stale, invalidated, or
unavailable state and repeats complete mobility and restriction validation. It
contains the Map route identity and digest, exact mobility-profile identity,
execution-neutral WGS84 path, validation identity, operational snapshot,
release provenance, and restriction identities. A consuming domain may add its
own actuation constraints, but it does not resolve places, plan a replacement
path, or reinterpret Map restrictions.

### Durable Routing Operations

Single routes, route matrices, and reachable areas use the MCP Task API. Each
operation persists its result before the task reaches `completed`. The task
record carries its owner, lease, progress, terminal payload, retention pins,
and recovery request. A client can poll or subscribe, cancel active work, and
read the resulting `map://` resource without holding the initiating request
open.

Route matrices are limited to 20 origins, 20 destinations, and 400 cells.
Individual unavailable cells are typed as unavailable; the entire matrix fails
when no pair has supported coverage.

`build_travel_model` serves a different contract from `route_matrix`. It
accepts one shared ordered set of up to 128 locations and as many as 64
vehicle types. Every vehicle type binds a stable Optimization-facing ID to one
exact Map mobility-profile version. The builder resolves and persists one
governed operational snapshot per requested vehicle type, then performs one
Valhalla many-to-many request. It publishes square objective-cost and
transit-time matrices with the same location order for every type.

Duration or distance may be the objective metric. Transit time is always
published separately. The time model is static or uses one invariant local
departure across all matrix cells. Per-origin dynamic departure propagation is
outside this artifact profile because it would make one cell depend on an
unknown upstream route sequence.

The artifact records `veoveo.io/travel-model-artifact/v1`, the exact
`map://travel-model/{travel_model_id}` identity, unavailable cell indices, and
the profile release, operational-snapshot, planner, cost-model, and matrix
algorithm provenance. The Map record retains its neutral `artifact://`
manifest URI. Optimization requires both identities and rejects a manifest
that does not attest the requested Map resource.

Reachable areas are Valhalla isochrones for human and road profiles. All four
operations renew leases while running and resume after a server restart.

## Spatial And Terrain Derivations

`derive_spatial_geometry` performs one bounded operation and persists its
result before returning. The supported operations are:

- line resampling;
- deterministic nearest-neighbor point ordering and closed tours;
- polygon boundaries and inward or outward standoff perimeters;
- line corridors and parallel lanes;
- racetracks with explicit turn direction;
- relay or station points;
- alternating coverage tracks clipped to polygon interiors and holes;
- connected components with an optional metric tolerance;
- lead-in and ingress geometry;
- complete-route validation.

Each request names one immutable mobility-profile version and may pin immutable
Map releases. It declares effective time and terrain classes. Output records
include typed findings, intersected restriction identities, the exact
projection origin, algorithm revision, request digest, geometry digest,
principal, and Work Context.

Inputs contain at most 10,000 coordinates. Connected-component requests contain
at most 512 geometries, and parallel-lane requests contain at most 128 lanes.
The server rejects an output above 50,000 coordinates. The local projection
rejects polar and dateline-spanning work instead of silently reducing
accuracy.

Terrain sampling remains a durable raster derivation. `corridor_maximum`
resamples a WGS84 line at a declared spacing, evaluates up to 64 cross-track
positions, and records no more than 10,000 samples. Its JSON artifact includes
every sampled position and value together with deterministic minimum and
maximum records. The source raster, band, source transform, checksums,
algorithm revision, caller, and Work Context use the same provenance contract
as every other raster derivation.

All tool results use structured content schemas. Tool and resource lists are
paginated. Task-only tools use the durable task extension.

The listed scope is necessary but not sufficient for a Work Context-owned
object. Reads require effective read access, edits require write access, and
publication, product creation, or archival requires effective admin access.

Map uses stateless Streamable HTTP. Ordinary responses are JSON, while
`subscriptions/listen` owns the request-scoped SSE stream carrying task,
resource, and resource-list notifications.

### Resources

Root resources are:

```text
map://sources
map://datasets
map://locations
map://facilities
map://mobility-profiles
map://restrictions
map://routes
map://matrices
map://travel-models
map://feature-layers
map://publications
map://layer-products
map://compositions
map://rasters
map://raster-derivations
map://spatial-derivations
```

Resource templates are:

```text

map://dataset/{dataset_id}
map://dataset/{dataset_id}/release/{release_id}
map://source-feature/{release_id}/{source_feature_id}

map://feature-layer/{layer_id}/publication/{publication_id}/product/{product_id}
map://composition/{composition_id}
map://composition/{composition_id}/revision/{composition_revision}
```

Source resources present public source fields. Routes and matrices are owner
scoped. Travel models are filtered by principal, gateway profile, tenant,
labels, and Work Context from their durable task owner. Dataset, geography,
profile, and restriction resources are tenant scoped. Authored layers,
publications, products, and compositions are Work Context scoped and filtered
by the caller's data labels. Raster derivation resources are confined to their
creating Work Context, while the immutable source raster remains tenant
scoped. Spatial derivations are also confined to their creating Work Context.

### Prompts And Completions

Map exposes `prepare_route_request`, `review_route`,
`prepare_logistics_matrix`, `prepare_optimization_travel_model`, and
`author_feature_layer`. The travel-model prompt carries stable shared IDs,
exact profile versions, units, limits, and the Map resource plus artifact
manifest into the Optimization routing tools. The authoring prompt directs
agents through resource inspection, validation, optimistic commit,
publication, and task-based bulk transfer without granting routing authority.

Completion applies to resource-template arguments and returns only visible ids.
The implementation completes source, dataset, release, location, facility,
profile, restriction, route, matrix, travel-model, layer, publication, product,
and composition identities from the caller's scope.

### Subscriptions And Notifications

Subscriptions cover the mutable dataset, restriction, route, travel-model,
feature-layer, publication-product, and composition surfaces. The server emits
resource-update and resource-list-change notifications after relevant
mutations. Subscription state is session local; durable long-running work uses
task subscriptions.

## Installation Bootstrap

Map consumes the platform's generic server-bootstrap contract
(`veoveo_mcp_contract::ServerBootstrapDocument`): a `server: map` envelope with
a `tenant_key` and a Map-owned payload of `sources` and `mobility_profiles`.
The deployment mounts the document at `/etc/veoveo/bootstrap/catalog.json` and
passes `--bootstrap-catalog`; the Helm chart renders it generically from
`serverBootstrap.map-mcp` without naming Map in core templates. Application is
create-only and idempotent: existing sources and mobility-profile versions are
skipped. The payload rejects unknown fields and mistargeted envelopes fail
closed. `map-mcp bootstrap-validate <path>` validates a document without
booting the server. Bootstrap never downloads, validates, or activates a
release; those remain governed operations by an authorized caller.

## Administration Over MCP

Administration crosses the same MCP boundary as every other operation
(`mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md` owns the contract). Mutations are
`map:admin`-scoped tools implemented in `administration.rs` and exposed from
`mcp.rs`:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `register_source` | register one governed source (idempotent on identical re-registration) |
| `replace_source` | replace source configuration under an expected record version |
| `disable_source` | disable future acquisition under an expected record version |
| `start_acquisition` | start a snapshot acquisition with an idempotency key |
| `cancel_acquisition` | request cancellation of a running job |
| `activate_release` | activate staged data or reconcile the active projection |
| `rollback_release` | activate a retained release |
| `quarantine_release` | quarantine an inactive release |
| `register_mobility_profile` | register an immutable profile version |

Dataset readers use `map://sources`, `map://datasets`,
`map://active-releases`, and `map://mobility-profiles`. Administrative job
reads use `map://acquisitions` and `map://acquisition/{acquisition_id}`.
Creation tools use idempotency keys; source and release mutations use expected record
versions; activation also uses the expected active-pointer version.
Validation failures surface as MCP invalid-params errors and concurrency
conflicts name the changed version.

The Map workspace ships as `ui://map/workspace.html` from
`assets/workspace-app.html`. It is listed when the caller has
`map:dataset:read`, `map:feature:read`, or `map:admin`, while
`map://workspace` tells the App which sections and controls to present. Every
operation remains scope-gated by its canonical resource or tool handler. The gateway projects the App under
`resource_projection: server_owned`, and the Console renders it from its generic
catalog; no map-specific Console page, BFF route, or REST router exists.

## Isolation And Security

Every SurrealDB catalog read includes the tenant id. Owner-scoped routes,
matrices, acquisition jobs, and artifacts also check the principal. DuckDB
tables include `tenant_key` in their primary keys, and every active-release
lookup is tenant constrained.

The public server validates the Host authority and a gateway-signed internal
token. Tool handlers enforce domain scopes again after gateway policy;
administrative tools and resources require `map:admin`. Secret references are
bounded identifiers; MCP resources expose those references.

Health reports DuckDB Spatial verification and both the supervised Valhalla
process and its loopback health. A failed routing process makes the Map health
endpoint unavailable.

## Operational Limits And Failure Semantics

- Location search returns at most 100 results.
- Resource list materialization reads at most 10,000 active locations and
  10,000 facilities before MCP pagination.
- A route accepts 32 waypoints and 3 alternatives.

  1,048,576 total matrix cells.
- Admin pages accept at most 200 records.
- Source elapsed time is within 1 second and 24 hours.
- Routing archive expansion defaults to 16 GiB and 5,000,000 entries.
- Route task leases last 120 seconds and renew every 40 seconds.
- Task records default to a 7-day TTL.
- Direct authored changesets contain at most 100 mutations and 1 MiB of encoded
  mutation data.
- Bulk imports contain at most 10,000 features and remain one atomic commit.
- Bulk input and output artifacts default to a 256 MiB byte limit.
- Feature queries return at most 1,000 records per page. CQL2 filters contain at
  most 64 nodes and nest at most 16 levels.
- A feature contains at most 50,000 coordinates, 256 properties, and 256 KiB of
  encoded properties.

  16,777,216 output pixels, class masks contain at most 256 class values, and
  a full-raster derivation reads at most 4,194,304 source pixels.
- A spatial input contains at most 10,000 coordinates and produces at most
  50,000. Terrain-corridor sampling produces at most 10,000 positions across
  no more than 64 cross-track offsets.
- Raster helpers inherit the 256 MiB artifact limit and terminate their process
  group after the configured five-minute deadline or task cancellation.
- The authored-feature R-tree performance gate uses 10,000, 100,000, and
  1,000,000 row fixtures, a two-second cold ceiling, a 250 ms warm p95 ceiling,
  a 5,000 indexed-row/s floor, and a 2 GiB database-size ceiling.
- The source-feature R-tree performance gate applies the same scales and
  latency, ingest-rate, and storage ceilings to the exact viewport query used
  by the workspace. It asserts the physical R-tree plan at every scale, checks
  results against a full-scan point oracle, verifies two index scans across the
  antimeridian, and inspects one million index leaves.

Unavailable coverage, invalid profile versions, disallowed advisory status,
unsupported objectives, source digest mismatch, unsafe archives, and
optimistic-concurrency conflicts all fail explicitly while preserving the
original question.

## Deployment

The container image is built from `servers/map-mcp/Dockerfile`. The Helm chart
mounts one `map-data` volume and the optional source exchange read-only, exposes
only port 8799 inside the cluster, and deploys one replica with a 100 GiB
`ReadWriteOnce` claim. The offline image lock contains
`veoveo/map-mcp:0.1.0` and its Dockerfile.

An installation selects its existing, controlled source PVC and optional
credential Secret through `domainServiceSourceMounts.map-mcp.exchangeClaim`
and `domainServiceSourceMounts.map-mcp.secretName`. The chart mounts these
objects read-only; it never copies source bytes or turns acquisition into a
Helm side effect. `domainServiceResources.map-mcp` independently sets the Map
pod's acquisition and indexing envelope without inflating every hosted server.

Important arguments include:

```text
--map-database
--duckdb-spill-dir
--spatial-extension
--duckdb-memory-limit
--duckdb-threads
--workspace-basemap-light-style-url
--workspace-basemap-dark-style-url

```

The image build pins the DuckDB C API and architecture-specific Spatial
extension, verifies its SHA-256 digest, compiles the Rust server, and copies
native map utilities from pinned images or packages. The runtime user is uid
10001. System packages are fixed during the image build.

## Dependencies

The server uses existing workspace crates for MCP, tasks, the platform store,
artifacts, gateway identity, and DuckDB hardening. Domain dependencies include:

| Crate | Use |

| `proj` | projected CRS transformations |
| `geographiclib-rs` | WGS84 geodesics |
| `geo` and `geojson` | topology and controlled interchange |

Valhalla remains a supervised native process because its routing model and
tile build are already mature. The Rust contract isolates that choice from MCP
clients.

## Verification

The implementation is checked at several boundaries:

- Rust contract tests cover ids, quantities, geometry, mobility taxonomy,
  source validation, geodesics, graph costs, Valhalla profile limits, URI
  parsing, paging, stable feature ids, routing archive bounds, travel-model
  bounds, and activation;
- DuckDB runtime tests cover controlled HTTPS source policy, closed Spatial axis
  selection, effective-setting verification, and a pinned extension-backed meter
  baseline;
- Python tests cover typed contracts, a bounded GTFS acquisition with validator
  execution, unsafe ZIP rejection, subprocess timeout, process-group
  termination, and bounded diagnostics;
- SurrealDB integration tests apply the schema to SurrealDB 3.2 and verify
  atomic release activation under record versions;
- Console TypeScript and production Vite builds validate the administrative
  projection;
- Map workspace contract tests verify one permission-aware App resource, the
  validated same-origin light and dark basemap contract and CSP declaration, exact MCP bridge operations,
  immutable publication and active-release queries, guided GeoPackage tasks,
  subscription wiring, the embedded MapLibre pin, and fail-closed hardware
  WebGL2 checks;
- the Rust Map workspace browser smoke serves the exact generated App under the
  Console's opaque-origin sandbox and an exact local MapLibre Style CSP. Headed Chrome
  must prove an NVIDIA WebGL adapter before the App completes bounded
  publication-pinned and active-release viewport queries, switches from light
  to dark basemap without moving the camera or losing overlays, synchronizes
  map and table selection, retains the map during governed-data inspection,
  and emits screenshot evidence;
- the container build verifies the pinned Spatial extension and packages GDAL,
  Osmium, Valhalla, and the Python application;
- the Rust Map smoke launches that image with a real SurrealDB 3.2 catalog and
  artifact service. It acquires and activates authority, OSM, and governed
  network fixtures, rejects a bad source digest before staging, and exercises
  named-location, facility, boundary, and corridor queries;
- the same smoke invokes road and maritime routing through the MCP Task API. It
  checks task creation and completion, executes a real Valhalla road route,
  executes a governed graph route, validates persistence, applies restriction
  risk, withdraws the restriction, and reads the invalidated dependent route;
- the broader smoke and conformance suites validate gateway, control-plane,
  offline, task, and MCP behavior.
- the cross-server compatibility test serializes the Map travel-model artifact
  and deserializes it directly as the Optimization contract without a
  translation shim.

The principal local commands are:

```text
cargo test -p veoveo-map-mcp --lib
cargo test -p veoveo-platform-store --lib
uv run --project servers/map-mcp/data --frozen python -m unittest discover -s servers/map-mcp/data/tests -v
npm --prefix servers/map-mcp/app ci
npm --prefix servers/map-mcp/app run build
npm --prefix apps/console/web run build
cargo xtask image build --target map-mcp
cargo xtask smoke map-mcp
cargo xtask smoke map-workspace-browser-verify
```

The risk-based suite targets representative acquisition, land routing,
governed-network routing, restriction, invalidation, Task API, and persistence
boundaries. Authority datasets and certified performance models add their own
domain acceptance cases as they enter an installation.
