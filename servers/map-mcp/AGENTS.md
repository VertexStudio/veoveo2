# Map MCP Server — Agent Manual

Delta over the repository root `AGENTS.md`. The normative server contract is
[`mcp/contract/DESIGN.md`](../../mcp/contract/DESIGN.md), revision 2.

## Purpose

Veoveo's Earth geography and logistics routing domain: places, facilities,
borders, coordinates, transport restrictions, routes, matrices, reachable
areas, cuOpt-ready travel models, governed source acquisition with immutable
release activation, and Work Context owned feature authoring. Administration
runs through the same typed MCP surface and its single permission-aware Map
workspace App.

## Invariants

- Canonical identity: slug `map`, URI scheme `map://`, endpoint `/map/mcp`,
  app `ui://map/workspace.html`. Resource identities
  keep the `map://` scheme under the gateway `map__` projection.
- SurrealDB is the canonical operational catalog. The tenant keyed DuckDB
  Spatial schema is a derived analytical projection and must stay
  rebuildable. Immutable bytes live in the artifact plane as
  `artifact://{artifact_id}` and are projected as
  `map://artifact/{artifact_id}` only after normal artifact policy.
- Coordinate exchange is WGS84 longitude and latitude with optional
  ellipsoidal height. PROJ handles bounded two dimensional projected CRS
  conversion; geocentric EPSG:4978 and vertical values are rejected rather
  than silently copied.
- Dataset releases are immutable and activation moves pointers. Acquisition
  runs only through registered sources with pinned host, redirect, media
  type, byte, time, and filesystem controls.
- Valhalla is a supervised loopback engine and an internal projection, never
  a public Map API.
- `build_travel_model` is the canonical Map-to-Optimization boundary. It
  preserves shared location order, binds each vehicle type to an exact
  mobility-profile version, records unavailable cells, and publishes
  `veoveo.io/travel-model-artifact/v1`. Never reconstruct these matrices in
  Optimization.
- Domain profile pins (DESIGN.md, Standards And Protocols): GeoJSON RFC 7946,
  OGC JSON-FG 1.0, RFC 8142 text sequences, OGC GeoPackage 1.4, Basic
  CQL2-JSON from OGC CQL2 1.0, GeoParquet 1.0.0, Mapbox Vector Tile 2.1,
  MapLibre Style 8, official MCP Tasks `2026-07-28`, apps extension
  `2026-01-26`.

## Build And Test

- `cargo check -p veoveo-map-mcp`
- `cargo test -p veoveo-map-mcp`
- The Map-to-Optimization compatibility test must prove that serialized travel
  model artifacts deserialize directly into the Optimization contract.
- Native builds need a C/C++ toolchain, CMake, pkg-config, SQLite development
  files, and PROJ build dependencies (root README, Develop And Verify). The
  DuckDB C library links through the pinned 1.5.5 `duckdb-rs` fork, which
  removes the upstream `comfy-table ~7.1` pin so it composes with Rerun 0.36.
- Docker is required for SurrealDB backed tests and deployment work.
- The image build verifies the Spatial extension digest and copies native map
  utilities from pinned sources (`servers/map-mcp/Dockerfile`).
- R-tree plan, correctness, and million-feature performance evidence requires
  `VEOVEO_TEST_DUCKDB_SPATIAL_EXTENSION` to name the exact pinned 1.5.5 Spatial
  extension. A skipped performance test is not acceptance evidence.
- `npm --prefix servers/map-mcp/app ci && npm --prefix servers/map-mcp/app run build`
  regenerates the self-contained workspace App from exact MapLibre GL JS and
  esbuild pins. The generated HTML must remain below the Console's 2 MiB limit.
- Browser acceptance for the workspace map requires headed Chrome and a proven
  hardware WebGL2 renderer. Static HTML tests or software graphics are not
  visual acceptance.
- `cargo xtask smoke map-workspace-browser-verify` serves the exact generated
  App under the Console's opaque-origin sandbox and offline CSP, completes a
  bounded immutable-publication viewport query, and records GPU and screenshot
  evidence.
