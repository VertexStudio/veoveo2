# Local k3d development

The local environment is a real Kubernetes installation. k3d owns the cluster,
Helm owns workload releases, and kubectl provides inspection and process control.
Each simulator keeps its values and gateway profile beside its own source. The
SUMO development cluster contains no simulator workload until that profile is
installed.

The Bioma enterprise reference uses a second cluster and explicit Kubernetes context.
It installs its GitOps controller as a separate local platform fixture, then reconciles
OCI charts through the same boundary expected in a fielded cluster. See
[`examples/bioma/README.md`](../../../examples/bioma/README.md).

One standalone OCI Distribution registry serves every local cluster on loopback
port 5001. All Veoveo images use full Git revisions as tags. Registry blob
deduplication moves only missing layers, and k3d nodes pull those layers through
the same registry contract used by connected enterprise clusters.

The development ingress has one canonical origin: `http://localhost:8780`.
Loopback HTTP is deliberate for the disposable local cluster. Fielded profiles
remain HTTPS-only and terminate TLS at their Kubernetes Ingress.

## Tool versions

[`versions.env`](versions.env) records the current stable release of every tool
and GPU runtime component used by this profile. Install those exact releases from
their upstream projects and place `k3d`, `kubectl`, and `helm` on `PATH`.

```bash
source deploy/local/k3d/versions.env

install -d ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSLo ~/.local/bin/k3d \
  "https://github.com/k3d-io/k3d/releases/download/$K3D_VERSION/k3d-linux-amd64"
curl -fsSLo ~/.local/bin/kubectl \
  "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$KUBECTL_VERSION/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
curl -fsSLo /tmp/helm.tar.gz \
  "https://get.helm.sh/helm-$HELM_VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
tar -xzf /tmp/helm.tar.gz -C /tmp
install /tmp/linux-amd64/helm ~/.local/bin/helm
chmod 0755 ~/.local/bin/k3d ~/.local/bin/kubectl

k3d version
kubectl version --client
helm version
```

Check the published SHA-256 files before installing downloaded binaries. The
repository dependency policy requires an upstream release check whenever one of
these versions is changed. `registry.json` pins the OCI Distribution image used
by local deployment profiles.

## GPU cluster

The node image combines K3s with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit and a CDI-enabled
containerd runtime. It does not embed an allocator. Each deployment profile chooses
the canonical managed DRA path or explicitly bootstraps the NVIDIA device plugin;
the two allocators never run on the same node. GPU workloads do not have a CPU fallback.
The reference profile publishes six time-sliced device-plugin allocations because
the authoritative UAV simulator, View, Stream, Reason, the cuOpt executor, and the
Rerun viewer MCP run at the same time. Each workload still requests one ordinary
`nvidia.com/gpu` resource. Time-slicing provides schedulability, not memory or
fault isolation. Profiles that need restart-stable physical pairing use the managed
DRA contract in [GPU placement](../../../docs/GPU_PLACEMENT.md).

```bash
nvidia-smi
source deploy/local/k3d/versions.env
docker build \
  --build-arg K3S_VERSION="$K3S_VERSION" \
  --build-arg CUDA_VERSION="$CUDA_VERSION" \
  --build-arg NVIDIA_CONTAINER_TOOLKIT_VERSION="$NVIDIA_CONTAINER_TOOLKIT_VERSION" \
  --tag "$VEOVEO_K3D_NODE_IMAGE" \
  deploy/local/k3d/node
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-up \
  --profile showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json

kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo get node -o 'custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPU:.status.allocatable.nvidia\.com/gpu'
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo delete job veoveo-gpu-probe --ignore-not-found
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo apply -f deploy/local/k3d/gpu-probe.yaml
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo wait --for=condition=complete job/veoveo-gpu-probe --timeout=5m
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo logs job/veoveo-gpu-probe
```

The probe requests one Kubernetes GPU and checks CUDA, the NVIDIA Vulkan ICD, and
the proprietary Vulkan device. A missing device, runtime, driver library, or
graphics capability fails the job.

The allocator-free node image is a hard cut. Rebuild the image and recreate any local
cluster made from the earlier image before selecting managed DRA. A cluster restart
does not remove a static device-plugin manifest already stored in that node.

## SUMO profile

The SUMO deployment owns these files:

- `showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json` composes the image groups and releases.
- `showcase/sumo/deploy/gateway.json` selects the SUMO MCP surface.
- `showcase/sumo/deploy/platform-values.yaml` removes unrelated domain services.
- `showcase/sumo/deploy/helm` defines the simulation and its MCP server.

Validate the profile, create the cluster, and publish one committed revision:

```bash
PROFILE=showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json
LOCK=output/deployments/sumo/deployment.lock.json
REVISION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
cargo xtask smoke profile-validate --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-up --profile "$PROFILE"
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo apply \
  -f deploy/local/k3d/development-resources.yaml
cargo xtask image builder ensure
cargo xtask release images \
  --profile "$PROFILE" \
  --profile-revision "$REVISION" \
  --lock-output "$LOCK"
cargo xtask smoke profile-up --profile "$PROFILE" --lock "$LOCK"
cargo xtask smoke sumo-verify --context k3d-veoveo-sumo
```

BuildKit pushes image layers directly to the registry. The SUMO images share
their pinned upstream runtime and LuST scenario through the layer cache; the
cluster pulls only missing blobs into containerd.

[`development-resources.yaml`](development-resources.yaml) is an
installation-owner fixture with public, fixed development credentials, including the
recording-scoped Redap signing key. Apply it explicitly after the cluster exists and
before `profile-up`. The profile tooling never applies, patches, replaces, or copies a
Secret. This fixture is valid only for this loopback cluster. A shared cluster uses
operator-created Secrets from its own reconciliation path.

`profile-up` renders every locked Helm chart and raw manifest before its first
Kubernetes or Helm write. It computes the complete Secret-reference closure, reads only
the presence and required key names from existing Secrets, and fails closed when a
Secret or key is missing or cannot be verified. Closure evidence never retains Secret
values.

Useful control commands remain standard Kubernetes operations:

```bash
k3d cluster list
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo -n veoveo get pods,services
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo -n veoveo logs -f deployment/sumo-mcp
kubectl --context k3d-veoveo-sumo -n veoveo rollout restart deployment/sumo-mcp
helm --kube-context k3d-veoveo-sumo -n veoveo list
```

## Troubleshooting after a host or Docker restart

A host or Docker restart normally preserves the cluster. One observed restart left
`k3d-veoveo-sumo-server-0` in `restarting` state even though k3d still reported the
cluster as running. The container retained its nominal Docker network attachment but
had no endpoint ID or IP address. k3s then stopped with:

```text
failed to start networking
failed to find interface with specified node ip
```

The resulting `kubectl` failure may instead report an `EOF` while downloading the
Kubernetes OpenAPI document. Capture the underlying state before restarting or deleting
anything:

```bash
k3d cluster list
docker inspect k3d-veoveo-sumo-server-0
docker network inspect k3d-veoveo-sumo
docker logs k3d-veoveo-sumo-server-0
```

If the server is restarting or lacks `NetworkSettings.Networks` values for `EndpointID`
or `IPAddress`, first try the non-destructive profile restart:

```bash
PROFILE=showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-stop --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-up --profile "$PROFILE"
```

If the node remains degraded, recreate the disposable cluster manually:

```bash
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-delete --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-up --profile "$PROFILE"
```

`profile-cluster-delete` removes the cluster's Kubernetes resources and local persistent
volumes. Preserve any required local data before running it. This network failure was
intermittent and did not recur across subsequent host restarts, so the harness does not
delete or repair Docker networking automatically.

## Cleanup

Remove the profile's Helm releases:

```bash
cargo xtask smoke profile-down \
  --profile showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json
```

Delete the cluster to remove all local Kubernetes state and persistent volumes:

```bash
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-delete \
  --profile showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json
```

The standalone registry remains available to other profiles after cluster
deletion. The complete local profile contract is documented in
[`../../../docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES.md`](../../../docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES.md).
