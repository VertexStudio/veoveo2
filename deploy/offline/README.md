# Offline installation bundle

`images.lock.json` is the canonical runtime image set. External images are
pinned by registry digest. Veoveo images use exact release tags and are recorded
by image id when a bundle is created.

Create a release bundle on a connected build host:

```sh
deploy/offline/create-bundle.sh \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --output output/veoveo-offline-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

The default release path requires `syft` and emits one SPDX JSON SBOM per image.
`--skip-sbom` is an explicit non-release escape hatch. The archive includes the
image tar, checksums, resolved image identities, Helm
chart, deployment contract, gateway configuration, and telemetry configuration.

The Stream image contains the DeepStream runtime, but site-approved TensorRT
engines are deployment inputs and are not embedded in the generic bundle. Place
the engine/model files and the completed `catalog.json`/nvinfer configuration
under the site-approved Kubernetes volumes before starting the offline
installation.
The connected bundle builder must authenticate to `nvcr.io` before building the
Stream image.

The bundle includes the derived `veoveo/cuopt-executor` image based on the
digest-pinned NVIDIA cuOpt 26.08 CUDA 13.3 runtime. Offline GPU nodes still need
a compatible NVIDIA driver, device plugin, and `nvidia` RuntimeClass.

On the offline host, verify and import into Docker, retaining the installation
payload and checksum/SBOM evidence under an empty destination directory:

```sh
deploy/offline/load-bundle.sh \
  --bundle output/veoveo-offline-0.1.0.tar.gz \
  --runtime docker \
  --install-dir /opt/veoveo
```

For Kubernetes nodes using containerd, use `--runtime containerd`. The loader
checks every file before import, verifies every image reference afterward, and
installs the payload at `/opt/veoveo`. Install
`/opt/veoveo/deploy/helm/veoveo` with
`/opt/veoveo/deploy/values.offline.yaml` so the kubelet uses
`imagePullPolicy: Never`. Bundle evidence remains in
`/opt/veoveo/bundle-evidence`. Secrets, TLS material, the internal OIDC
configuration, and site-specific gateway/telemetry configuration are supplied
inside the offline boundary and are never embedded in the bundle.

Create the gateway refresh-delivery key inside that boundary with
`openssl rand -base64 32`. Store it under `refresh-delivery-key-b64` in
`global.existingSecret`. It must decode to exactly
32 bytes and must not reuse any signing or console session key.

Create the recording-scoped Redap key independently with
`openssl rand -base64 32`. Store it under `recording-playback-token-key` in
`global.existingSecret`. It must decode to exactly 32 bytes and must not reuse
the refresh-delivery, gateway signing, object-store, or Console session keys.

The offline deployment keeps the same default five-second
`VEOVEO_REFRESH_DELIVERY_WINDOW_SECONDS` /
`gateway.refreshDeliveryWindowSeconds` behavior as a connected installation.
It lets concurrent stateless BFF requests receive the identical rotated
successor recovered from an authenticated encrypted envelope. The plaintext
successor is never persisted or emitted to logs, audit, outbox, or snapshots;
use after the window is delayed replay and revokes the refresh-token family. A
successor consumption clears its envelope atomically; otherwise a dedicated
one-minute GC pass physically removes expired ciphertext.

Offline Kubernetes installations must also preserve the chart's dedicated `/s`
Ingress log suppression. The default annotation targets ingress-nginx; replace
`ingress.publicShareAnnotations` with the installed controller's access-log
disable or redaction policy before exposing anyone-with-link artifact URLs.
