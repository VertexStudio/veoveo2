# Veoveo Code Map

This map identifies ownership boundaries and the shortest path to the code behind a
behavior. It describes only the current hard-cut architecture.

The canonical long-form sources are
[`veoveo-whitepaper-print.html`](veoveo-whitepaper-print.html) and
[`autonomy-harness-print.html`](autonomy-harness-print.html). Their source headers carry
the headed Chrome `Page.printToPDF` contract that produces the
[`whitepaper PDF`](veoveo-whitepaper.pdf) and
[`harness PDF`](autonomy-harness.pdf). [`autonomy-harness.html`](autonomy-harness.html)
is the browser edition of the harness document. These three publication
surfaces describe the same 16-server catalog and use the normative component
designs above for Stream, Reason, authoritative UAV live view, Recording
Hub, administration, and GPU policy.

## Placement Rules

The top-level directories express ownership rather than implementation language. A Rust
crate belongs beside the system it implements; Rust is not an architectural boundary.

| Root | Put code here when it owns |
|---|---|
| `servers/` | a hosted MCP server with its own protocol surface, deployment image, and domain behavior |
| `mcp/` | protocol contracts, transport extensions, or bridges shared by more than one server |
| `extensions/` | cross-cutting contracts and reference material for independently owned extension repositories |
| `platform/` | internal control/data-plane services, durable stores, and reusable execution runtimes |
| `agents/` | autonomous agent behavior or durable agent scheduling |
| `apps/` | a user-facing application and its application-specific backend |
| `testing/` | cross-component conformance, smoke, and deployment verification |
| `sdk/` | a language-native client or server-development package |
| `showcase/` | an end-to-end domain integration that is not part of the core installation |

MCP servers do not live under a generic `tools/` root. They expose resources, prompts,
tasks, subscriptions, notifications, and structured content in addition to tools, so
`servers/` names the deployable boundary without narrowing the protocol.

## Shared Contracts

### `mcp/apps-extension`

MCP Apps (SEP-1865 / ext-apps "2026-01-26") support: pinned protocol
constants (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`, `text/html;profile=mcp-app`), typed
`_meta.ui` shapes, server helpers (capability declaration, `ui://` app
resources, tool links), and host helpers (capability declaration, app
detection, and visibility checks). The Console owns the generic reactive-resource
adapter that carries final-profile `subscriptions/listen` wakes across the pinned Apps
bridge without exposing domain payloads. `mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md` is the
canonical server↔core↔UI contract: domain reads are resources, domain
mutations are tools, domain views are `ui://` apps — never bespoke admin
REST or hardcoded console pages.

### `mcp/bridges`

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `stdio` | Same-version MCP `2026-07-28` bridge for one explicitly owned local child; the HTTP endpoint is stateless and discovers the child through the final lifecycle |
| `legacy` | Optional, isolated MCP `2025-11-25` external connector for one configured local stdio child or remote HTTP endpoint; it exposes only MCP `2026-07-28` tools, resources, prompts, and completions toward Veoveo and never fabricates Tasks, MRTR, subscriptions, or deprecated capabilities |


### `mcp/contract`

This crate owns vocabulary shared across services. It must not absorb a domain tool
schema merely because the server is first-party.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `access.rs` | artifact access levels, user/group subjects, grant composition |
| `agents.rs` | authenticated operator-message, durable input-request decision, wake-receipt, and pending-input view contracts |
| `artifact_service.rs` | artifact-plane requests, capabilities, share links, native async port |
| `duckdb.rs` | shared DuckDB source types and safe read-function SQL fragments |
| `coordinates.rs` | shared coordinate spaces, world/revision/frame identities, complete frame-tree vocabulary, WGS84 positions, and operation provenance |
| `docs.rs` | build-embedded server documents, once-built revision/compliance declarations, compliance parsing, and canonical llms.txt rendering; observed capabilities come from Discover and list methods |
| `uri.rs` | canonical hosted-server resource URI construction and shared one-segment document URI parsing |
| `storage.rs` | artifact metadata, release state, compliance labels |
| `gateway.rs` | gateway control-plane aggregate and public re-exports |
| `gateway/ids.rs` | validated identity and configuration newtypes, including bounded principal display metadata that never participates in authorization |
| `gateway/auth_config.rs` | IdP, authorization server, OAuth client surfaces |
| `gateway/server_config.rs` | hosted server and profile exposure contracts, including exact cross-server App resource dependencies |
| `gateway/policy.rs` | actions, targets, rules, effects, audit reason model |
| `gateway/runtime_state.rs` | durable auth/runtime record contracts, including display metadata continuity across authorization-code and refresh grants |
| `gateway/validation.rs` | fail-closed cross-reference and invariant validation |
| `gateway/composition.rs` | typed external server fragments, installation bindings, deterministic pure composition, requirements, and provenance |
| `internal_auth.rs` | Ed25519 signing keys, JWKS trust, internal issuer/verifier |
| `deployment.rs` | Connected/offline Kubernetes topology contract |
| `bootstrap.rs` | generic installation-time server bootstrap envelope, constants, and semantics |
| `tasks.rs` | platform task ownership and durable routing vocabulary; official MCP Task wire types come from `rmcp` |
| `provider.rs` | provider job/event contracts; no status polling API |
| `subscriptions.rs` | request-scoped resource and list-change event hub for final `subscriptions/listen` streams |
| `protocol.rs` | sole final MCP revision, shared cache lifetimes, and bounded W3C trace metadata validation |
| `transport.rs` | canonical stateless Streamable HTTP configuration, no-session adapter, and whole-response 8 MiB final JSON budget enforcement |
| `telemetry.rs` | tracing/log initialization and guards |

### `mcp/composer`

Owns the offline `gateway-compose` native/OCI command. It reads matched anonymous or
private extension fragments and installation bindings, calls the pure contract
composer, and writes one ordinary validated control plane plus requirements and
path-free content provenance.

### `platform/recordings/rrd`

Owns cross-domain Rerun/RRD spacetime types, adapters, encoded-video boundary
inspection, canonical recording-layer Store ID normalization, deterministic properties
layers, and bounded Arrow IPC projection. Domain results that do not overlap Rerun
concepts stay local to their MCP crate.

### `platform/recordings/video`

Owns governed video selection and task-start materialization shared by Stream replay and
Reason. It consumes Recording MCP read plans, combines immutable Artifact-backed layers with
complete acknowledged live ingest parts, and remuxes the bounded H.264 range without
re-encoding.

### `platform/recordings/protocol`

Owns the versioned protobuf contract for authenticated recording streams, batches,
checkpoints, discovery, and errors. Gateway, Record Hub, the forwarder, and smoke tests
share this crate.

## SurrealDB Platform Store

### `platform/store`

The only durable platform persistence layer.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `config.rs` | root/database auth configuration and validation |

| `gateway_runtime.rs` | control revisions, auth state, refresh/JWT runtime records |
| `artifacts.rs` | blob, occurrence, grant, share, capability transactions |
| `coordinates.rs`, `frame_worlds.rs` | coordinate-operation persistence plus authored frame worlds and immutable tree revisions |
| `map.rs` | source, release, active-pointer, mobility, restriction, snapshot, route, matrix, and acquisition persistence |
| `map_authoring.rs` | Work Context-scoped feature layers, immutable schema/style/feature revisions, atomic changesets, heads, publications, and authoring outbox events |
| `map_presentations.rs` | Immutable publication products plus governed, publication-pinned map compositions and revisions |
| `time.rs` | authority sources and releases, active pointers, acquisitions, calendars, epochs, clock policy, and events |
| `recordings.rs` | recording lifecycle and visibility |
| `recording_ingest.rs`, `recording_blueprints.rs` | producer streams, idempotent batch checkpoints, immutable producer Blueprint revisions, and journal state |
| `usage.rs` | shared domain/media usage records |
| `outbox.rs`, `changefeed.rs` | transactional events, checkpoints, LIVE acceleration |
| `live_views.rs` | append-only audit records for authoritative simulation live-view products and ephemeral viewer authorizations |
| `migrations/0040_uav_vehicle_authority.surql` | UAV-owned principal-to-vehicle grants, admitted single-vehicle mission plans, and exclusive command leases scoped by tenant and Work Context |
| `store.rs` | connection and transaction helpers over domain records |

Migrations `0001` through the current version live under `migrations/`. Runtime services
never apply them; installation bootstrap does.

## Durable Tasks

### `platform/task-runtime`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `types.rs` | runtime configuration, recovery classes, pins, claims, outcomes |
| `runtime.rs` | create/idempotency, lease, update, cancel, finish, recover, prune |
| `mcp.rs` | projection from durable state into official RMCP Task and DetailedTask types |
| `service.rs` | protocol-neutral durable service boundary delegated from RMCP handlers |
| `lib.rs` | focused public API |

The runtime is the source of truth. RMCP owns the sole Tasks wire model.

## Gateway

### Library surface: `platform/gateway/src`

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `catalog.rs` | validated active catalog and profile/server lookup |
| `control_store.rs` | immutable SurrealDB control revisions and activation |
| `auth/` | access tokens, OIDC, ID-JAG, client assertions, immutable principals, and independently typed OIDC display labels |
| `policy.rs` | policy evaluation entrypoint |
| `mcp_support.rs` | MCP URI projection, including declared cross-server resource identities |
| `mcp/authorization.rs` | per-method/profile/server target authorization |
| `mcp/discovery.rs` | exact-authority catalog discovery cache, bounded concurrency, per-server failure isolation, and list-change invalidation |
| `mcp/tools.rs` | aggregated tool projection with explicit helper gating; failure-isolated by default and list-failing for `fail_closed` discovery profiles |
| `mcp/resources.rs` | failure-isolated resource/list projection plus fail-closed read/subscribe routing |
| `mcp/prompts.rs`, `completion.rs` | prompt and completion projection |
| `mcp/tasks.rs` | canonical upstream task client and explicit weak-client task projection |
| `mcp/health.rs` | explicit `health_url` GET probing where only a success status is healthy |
| `mcp/upstream*.rs` | authenticated Streamable HTTP, session-local protocol state, and catalog-revision-scoped sharing of transport-equivalent HTTP/TLS clients |
| `state/audit.rs` | durable policy/audit evidence |
| `state/auth_state.rs` | durable OAuth authorization and replay state |
| `state/refresh_tokens.rs` | refresh family issue/rotate/replay/revoke/GC plus signed-in display-label continuity |
| `state/subscriptions.rs` | durable subscription ownership and forwarding |
| `secrets.rs` | secret-source models and environment/file/Vault resolution |

### Binary surface: `platform/gateway/src/bin/gateway`

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `server.rs` | router assembly only |
| `runtime.rs` | shared application state and HTTP clients |
| `oauth/`, `oauth_grants/` | authorize/callback/token and grant handlers |
| `admin/control_plane.rs` | control revision read/update |
| `admin/tasks.rs` | policy-checked cancellation through the owning server's official Tasks endpoint |
| `admin/artifacts.rs` | release/grant/link mutations through artifact service |
| `admin/console/mod.rs` | console snapshot handler, trusted display-name projection for every principal with authenticated-identity precedence, branding, stream cursor bootstrap |
| `admin/console/projection.rs` | tenant projection load and per-entity summary builders |
| `admin/console/stream.rs` | live console SSE: LIVE wake hub, changefeed replay, tenant filtering, limits |
| `admin/console/health.rs` | background MCP server health prober and cache |
| `admin/server_proxy.rs` | generic policy-checked proxy to a hosted server's contract-defined admin API |
| `artifact_download.rs` | authorized/audited large download proxy |
| `recording_playback.rs` | authorized/audited playback manifest and framed live-stream pass-through |
| `audit.rs` | common admin authorization and operation audit helpers |

`gateway.rs` remains the thin CLI/serve entrypoint.

## Artifact Plane

### `platform/artifacts/service`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `service.rs` | policy enforcement, grants, release, shares, quotas, retention |
| `ledger.rs` | repository contract and in-memory test implementation |
| `ledger/surreal.rs` | canonical SurrealDB repository adapter |
| `store.rs` | memory/S3 blob storage and signed download behavior |
| `auth.rs` | internal assertion verification and plane caller |
| `http.rs` | internal artifact API plus `/s/{token}` redemption |
| `config.rs` | fail-closed store/database/audience configuration |

### `platform/artifacts/client`

HTTP implementation of the `ArtifactPlane` interface used by domain servers and the
gateway. It forwards the caller's existing signed identity; it never signs one.

### `servers/artifact-mcp`

The canonical MCP-facing artifact projection. `handler.rs` owns tools/resources,
`prompts.rs` owns reusable workflows, and `subscriptions.rs` owns update notification
plumbing.

## Domain Servers

The Rust MCP server pattern is intentionally consistent:

| Local module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `contract.rs`, `contract/`, or `domain/` | tool, resource, problem, and result types owned by the domain |
| `engine.rs`, `forecast.rs`, `compiler/`, or another focused engine module | pure domain computation or deterministic provider compilation |
| `verification/` | provider-independent checks when the domain publishes separately verified results |
| `executor/` | private typed provider protocol and client; never a second public API |
| `state.rs` | server-local provider and domain models, not task persistence |
| `uris.rs` | canonical server resource identities |
| `artifacts.rs` | task-bound capability preparation/redemption |
| `administration.rs` | transport-neutral domain administration behind `map:…`-style admin-scoped MCP tools |
| `assets/` | self-contained `ui://` MCP App views served through `read_resource` |
| `bin/server/config.rs` | validated CLI/environment configuration |
| `bin/server/internal_auth.rs` | required gateway assertion middleware |
| `bin/server/ownership.rs` | principal/tenant/label task ownership |
| `bin/server/task_extension.rs` | final extension adapter over TaskRuntime |
| `bin/server/app_state.rs` | dependency composition and recovery |
| `bin/server/outputs.rs` | result models, resource links, and usage projection |

Current MCP crates under `servers/` are indexed here:

| Path | Primary ownership |
|---|---|
| `servers/artifact-mcp` | MCP resources, tools, prompts, and subscriptions over the artifact plane |
| `servers/duckdb-mcp` | arbitrary analytical SQL, governed ingest/export, and DuckDB Spatial |
| `servers/frames-mcp` | complete rooted frame worlds, immutable revisions, coordinate conversion, and operation provenance |

| `servers/reason-mcp` | local recorded-video reasoning, grounding, and Rerun annotations |
| `servers/recording-mcp` | governed recording catalog, queries, subscriptions, and sealing |
| `servers/timeseries-mcp` | time-series analysis, forecasting, evaluation, canonical artifact handoff, and artifacts |

The packaged Node chart server keeps its Veoveo boundary beside the image:

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `servers/chart-mcp/server.mjs` | canonical mounted Streamable HTTP lifecycle, hosted identity, well-known resources, and derived declaration over the pinned upstream chart server |
| `servers/chart-mcp/internal-auth.mjs` | fail-closed Ed25519 gateway-token verification shared by the chart MCP and admin docs routes |

### Geospatial Domains

The geospatial hard cut has three canonical servers:

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `servers/map-mcp` | Earth geography, complete immutable source features, governed COG rasters and terrain derivations, reusable spatial geometry and mobility validation, authored GeoJSON/JSON-FG layers, bounded OGC GeoPackage vector transfer, source acquisition, release activation, DuckDB Spatial analytics, CRS and geodesic work, geofences, restrictions, Valhalla land routing, governed network routing, matrices, Optimization travel models, and reachable areas |
| `servers/frames-mcp` | ECEF-rooted world trees, geodetic/static/dynamic transforms, immutable revisions, bounded coordinate conversion, durable batch work, operation provenance, artifacts, and usage |
| `servers/view-mcp` | governed static scene compositions, configured 3D scene layers, camera rigs, exact Map/Frames/Artifact inputs, bounded overlays, NVIDIA-accelerated rendering, and frame resources |

The crate-local design documents own their protocol, administration, persistence, and
deployment details.

View composition work starts in `src/contract/composition.rs`, which owns
strong identities, governed inputs, Frames bindings, overlay geometry, styles,
validity, and bounds. `src/composition.rs` resolves exact artifact bytes and
converts validated overlays into GPU render products. `src/state.rs` owns
principal and Work Context scoped composition, view, capture snapshot, and
frame state. `src/mcp.rs` publishes the canonical tools and resources, while
`src/server/tasks.rs` persists recoverable capture snapshots.

Map authoring is split by responsibility. `src/contract/features.rs` owns feature wire
types and bounds, while `src/contract/compositions.rs` owns publication products and
composition contracts. `src/contract/transfers.rs` owns durable import, export, and
vector-product task contracts. `src/authoring/service.rs` applies Work Context policy
and optimistic concurrency. `src/authoring/projection.rs` consumes canonical SurrealDB outbox events,
while `src/authoring/query.rs` owns the parameterized DuckDB Spatial and bounded CQL2
query projection. `src/authoring/query/performance.rs` owns the 10k, 100k, and
million-feature R-tree plan, correctness, maintenance, latency, throughput, and
storage gates. `src/authoring/presentations.rs` governs immutable products and
composition revisions. `src/authoring/transfers.rs` owns canonical bounded GeoJSON
and RFC 8142 transfer plus GeoParquet 1.0 and MVT 2.1 products.
`data/src/map_data/feature_package.py` and `src/feature_packages.rs` own the
pinned-GDAL OGC GeoPackage inspection and conversion boundary.
`src/mcp/authoring.rs` publishes the write and query tools. `src/server/tasks.rs` owns
durable execution and task-local staging, while
`src/server/tasks/feature_transfers.rs` owns GeoPackage-aware transfer execution.
`app/` owns the exact MapLibre bundle pipeline and the permission-aware source,
while `assets/workspace-app.html` is the generated self-contained Map MCP App
for composition viewing, feature authoring, and administration. The canonical SurrealDB schemas are
`platform/store/migrations/0025_map_authoring.surql`
and `platform/store/migrations/0026_map_authoring_products.surql`.

Immutable acquisition products use a separate analytical path.
`src/contract/source_products.rs` owns complete source-feature, raster-product,
query, and derivation contracts. `src/release_products.rs` projects activated
GeoJSON, GeoJSON Sequence, and raster metadata into DuckDB Spatial.
`data/src/map_data/adapters/` owns bounded normalization, while
`data/src/map_data/raster_ops.py` performs the controlled GDAL derivations.
`src/raster.rs` supervises that helper and `src/server/tasks.rs` owns its
durable artifact publication. `src/geography.rs` owns direct governed
position, location, and corridor inspection plus restriction publication,
surfaced through tools such as `inspect_position`, while `src/analytics.rs`
owns the sandboxed DuckDB Spatial engine behind those reads.
`src/analytics/performance.rs` owns the active-source 10k, 100k, and
million-feature R-tree plan, correctness, latency, throughput, and storage
gates.

Reusable spatial planning is split from routing. `src/contract/spatial.rs`
owns the bounded operation and persisted-result schemas. `src/spatial/derive.rs`
implements pure geometry, `src/spatial/projection.rs` owns the exact local
projection profile, and `src/spatial/validation.rs` resolves mobility envelopes
and active restrictions. `src/spatial/mod.rs` binds catalog authority,
provenance, and DuckDB persistence.

### Optimization And Travel Models

## Recordings

### `platform/recordings/protocol`

`proto/veoveo/recording/ingest/v1/ingest.proto` is the canonical public wire schema.
`src/lib.rs` owns media types, route constants, limits, digest validation, and generated
types.

### `platform/recordings/hub`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ingest_http.rs` | cluster-internal authenticated protobuf routes and typed error projection |
| `ingest.rs` | producer authorization, atomic no-clobber journal and Blueprint publication, quota-bound append, ordered live parts, capture-layer rollover, publication recovery, and restart reconciliation |

| `ingest.rs` | authenticated durable-part journal projection, compact static-context snapshots, and decoder-reentrant rollover |
| `spool.rs` | direct loopback writer, decoder-reentrant rollover, and archive freeze |
| `bin/spooler.rs` | thin composition of authenticated ingest, loopback Rerun receiver, catalog, and shutdown |
| `bin/hub_smoke.rs` | Rust crash/restart/rollover/catalog smoke scenarios |

### `platform/recordings/video`

The shared governed recorded-video access crate. `src/lib.rs` owns the
`RecordingVideoSelection`/`IndexRange`/`VideoTimelineKind` selection contract,
bounded `VideoSourceLimits`, read-plan-authorized clip materialization with
no-transcode MP4 remux, and canonical recording-URI validation. Every server
that consumes `VideoStream` recordings (Stream replay and Reason) uses this crate
instead of a private video path.

### `servers/recording-mcp`

`contract.rs` owns recording, layer, seal, playback-manifest v9, Blueprint, and live
descriptor types. `service.rs` resolves authorized MCP and playback plans and publishes
properties layers. `service/projection.rs` owns projection receipts, concurrency,
scratch, and Arrow downloads. `layer_cache.rs` owns verified bounded Artifact-to-PVC
materialization and eviction. `playback.rs` owns durable grants, dataset-scoped virtual
Rerun catalogs, finite governed Blueprint sources, and the scoped read-only Redap service.
`live_playback.rs` retains recording-scoped static context across ingest generations, filters
bounded temporal history, and rewrites messages to the stable playback identity.
`live_stream.rs` frames complete RRD batches for the authorized WebViewer `LogChannel` and
distinguishes an empty-channel bootstrap from a current-head transport resume.
`uris.rs` owns recording identities. `bin/server.rs` composes the authenticated manifest,
framed live route, Redap, projections, MCP transports, storage readiness and diagnostics,
and Artifact publication.

### `servers/stream-mcp`

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/contract.rs` | live-session, replay, video, result, sampling, detection, timeline, and output types |
| `src/catalog.rs` | validated admitted GStreamer graphs, typed profiles, live ingress, and immutable model catalog |
| `src/executor.rs` | bounded native replay-runner protocol and response validation |
| `src/annotation.rs` | derived Rerun bounding-box annotation layers |
| `src/artifacts.rs` | shared artifact-plane adapter |
| `src/uris.rs` | canonical `stream://` identities |
| `src/bin/server/live.rs` | owner-scoped live runner lifecycle plus bounded result and encoded-preview rings |
| `src/bin/server/recording_output.rs` | optional bounded non-blocking fan-out of existing H.264 units to the pod-local Recording forwarder |
| `src/bin/server/app.rs`, `assets/live.html` | self-contained Stream MCP App resource for actual encoded video, typed overlays, and exact decode-path reporting |
| `src/bin/server/` | auth, replay tasks, live sessions, prompts, resources, notifications, and composition |
| `gst-runner/` | native operator-admitted GStreamer graph execution with NVIDIA decode/inference and typed event output |
| `Dockerfile` | DeepStream 9 development/runtime multi-stage image |

`recording-mcp::service::read` owns the reusable governed Artifact-backed read plan, and
`platform/recordings/video` owns selection and materialization over it;
Recording-based durable Stream replay remains fail-closed until its own design supplies
a fresh Artifact-read capability after restart. Live Stream sessions consume their
admitted ingress directly and do not depend on Recording Hub.

### `servers/reason-mcp`

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/contract.rs` | reasoning tasks, decode policy, grounding, results, and output types |
| `src/catalog.rs` | validated world-model checkpoint and reasoning pipeline catalog |
| `src/executor.rs` | bounded world-model runner protocol and response validation |
| `src/grounding.rs` | typed Stream-results grounding subset extraction |
| `src/annotation.rs` | derived Rerun provenance and event annotation layers |
| `src/artifacts.rs` | shared artifact-plane adapter |
| `src/uris.rs` | canonical `reason://` identities |
| `src/bin/server/` | auth, tasks, prompts, resources, notifications, and composition |
| `runner/` | Python world-model runner: typed protocol, frame sampling, vLLM inference |
| `Dockerfile` | vLLM runtime image with the server binary and installed runner |

Reason embeds a bounded grounding subset in the durable request at submission time. Its
recording-video materialization remains fail-closed until a fresh Artifact-read
capability can be recovered without persisting a caller bearer. The runner binary belongs to
the deployable image and the engine is a site-compiled deployment input, so the
server fails readiness until both are present.

## Python Servers

### `sdk/python`

The shared platform package for hosted Python MCP servers. It is the Python
counterpart of the workspace crates a Rust server composes; the Rust side
stays the source of truth for every wire shape and schema.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `contract/` | identity, artifact-plane, and usage wire models |
| `internal_auth.py` | gateway Ed25519 assertion verification and ASGI middleware |
| `host.py` | host-authority validation and 421 rejection |
| `deployment.py`, `pagination.py` | mount identities and cursor pagination |
| `schema.py` | self-contained JSON Schema 2020-12 generation for MCP tool inputs |
| `task_extension/` | typed official Tasks SDK-hook adapter, models, and projection |
| `tasks/` | durable SurrealDB task runtime port: leases, CAS transitions, outbox, recovery, prune |
| `artifacts.py` | artifact-plane HTTP client and capability redemption |

### `templates/python-mcp`

The canonical template for new Python servers, shipped as the working
`datasheet` dataset-profiling server. `contract.py` and `engine.py` own the
domain; `server/` mirrors the Rust per-server module split (config, ownership,
official Tasks adapter, durable task, MCP surface, composition).

## Agents

### `agents/runtime`

SurrealDB-backed agent, episode, task watcher, wake, lease, and scheduling persistence.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `control.rs` | database-authenticated, exact-context external operator messages and input-request decisions with UUIDv7 idempotency, durable wakes, actor attribution, and a domain-neutral conversation projection over wakes and episodes |
| `runtime.rs` | lease-fenced agent mutations, inactive-manifest reconciliation, race-safe durable input-request terminal waits, and atomic terminal-delivery consumption with first-party Task retention release |

### `agents/kernel`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `manifest.rs` | agent, model, profile, tool, budget, and bounded MCP resource-subscription configuration models |
| `episode.rs` | bounded reasoning episode lifecycle |
| `background_tasks.rs` | immediate model-visible handoff from accepted durable tool calls to credential-rotating kernel watchers |
| `tools.rs` | MCP tool dispatch and durable task descriptor capture |
| `tasks.rs` | detached watcher lease/resume/result-to-wake flow |
| `wake.rs` | outbox/changefeed wake delivery, including heartbeat-only batches acknowledged without an episode |
| `memory.rs` | durable memory API over analytical stores |
| `timeline.rs` | snapshot dataframe read-back over the agent's RRD segments with bounded most-recent-rows output because rows become model input |
| `context.rs` | per-episode context assembly as a view over the memory planes |
| `llm.rs` | episode LLM construction from the manifest's provider-neutral model config |
| `input.rs` | durable application input for protocol-neutral deferred tools |
| `replay.rs`, `summary.rs` | domain-truth rebuild from the decision log and deterministic episode summaries |
| `rrd.rs`, `recorder.rs` | episode/world Rerun recording |
| `budget.rs` | enforced episode/tool/cost budgets |
| `connection.rs` | final-profile gateway client epoch, serialized request-boundary credential freshness, acknowledged request-scoped listener restoration, and deferred-task resolver |
| `resource.rs` | governed current-profile resource reads, episode-local accounting, admitted text validation, and bounded correction diagnostics |

### `platform/gateway/src/bin/gateway/admin`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `agents.rs` | policy and audit boundary for user or service agent messages, actor-attributed conversation reads, pending input-request reads, and decisions; resolves the caller's tenant and Work Context before using the runtime control plane |

## Console

### `apps/console/bff`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `oauth.rs` | PKCE login, token exchange, refresh rotation, and shared Console/standalone-App return settlement |
| `session.rs` | XChaCha20-Poly1305 cookies, CSRF material, and bounded same-origin `BrowserReturnPath` authority |
| `app_host.rs` | typed `/apps/{server}/{page...}` route authority, public no-store entry document, and caller-authorized App bootstrap |
| `api.rs` | snapshot, SSE, mutation, artifact preview/download, and same-origin CSRF-protected agent-message/input-request BFF projections; browser credentials and database authority never enter an MCP App |
| `recording_playback.rs` | authenticated playback-manifest and framed live-stream pass-through; no archive bytes or BFF session store |
| `apps.rs`, `mcp_client.rs` | MCP Apps host backend: auth-scoped final-profile client pool, public gateway authority preservation, reactive failure-isolated app catalog, standalone descriptors, sandboxed frame serving, declared agent-message targets, allowlisted tool calls, explicit resource-read settlement, configured listener/subscription admission, bounded token-replacement cancellation, and one multiplexed resource-wake stream per App |
| `config.rs`, `viewer_config.rs` | validated public/gateway/OAuth-resource/MCP-transport and embedded-map configuration, exact profile binding, redacted provider credentials, and the authenticated no-store Rerun map projection |
| `outbound_http.rs` | additive installation CA trust shared by Console HTTP, streaming, live, MCP, and Kubernetes clients |

### `apps/console/web/src`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `App.tsx` | application shell: platform navigation plus catalog-driven MCP App entries, topbar, view routing, drawer mounting |
| `appHost.tsx`, `StandaloneAppHost.tsx`, `standaloneBootstrap.ts` | minimal standalone App entry, authorized same-path bootstrap, shared OAuth/CSRF settlement, authorized title, and Console return link |
| `views/Recordings.tsx` | searchable lifecycle browser and lazy Rerun playback workspace |
| `components/GovernedRerunViewer.tsx`, `rerunSources.ts`, `rerunLiveChannel.ts`, `recordingRrdFetch.ts`, `rerunMap.ts` | persistent WebViewer lifecycle, producer Blueprint-first opening, one native incremental-RRD or lazy-archive receiver, exact same-origin RRD authorization, duplicate-free current-head reconnect, event-driven rollover without cursor forcing, archive-only credential renewal, and installation-owned browser map-provider activation |
| `views/Agents.tsx`, `agentControl.ts` | reactive agent state, actor-attributed conversation, durable message submission, pending input-request decisions, and client-owned UUIDv7 retry identity |
| `views/` | remaining platform-plane views (overview, work, artifacts, MCP, apps, access, audit, cluster); domain views ship as MCP Apps, never here |
| `drawers/ArtifactDrawer.tsx` | artifact preview, recording provenance, download, release, grant, and share-link workflows |
| `drawers/` | remaining detail drawers with mutation workflows |
| `components/ArtifactPreview.tsx` | bounded text and inline image/audio/video/PDF previews with explicit governed-access failures |
| `components/GovernedRerunViewer.tsx` | recording-scoped exclusive Redap archive or bounded-live delivery with a separate producer Blueprint presentation store |
| `identity.ts`, `components/IdentityText.tsx` | trusted display-name resolution for arbitrary principal ids with UUID-compacting fallback, rendered across access, agents, and artifact views |
| `components/` | reusable primitives, tables, toolbar, and the promise-based confirm dialog |
| `queries.ts`, `queryClient.ts` | TanStack Query keys, snapshot/apps/cluster queries, mutation hooks with targeted cache patches |
| `live.ts` | EventSource console stream feeding row upserts into the snapshot cache |
| `theme.ts`, `ThemeProvider.tsx` | persisted Console theme registry, semantic palette selection, and MCP App light/dark host context |
| `apps/` | MCP Apps host: one exported opaque-origin sandbox policy, shared iframe component, stable postMessage bridge, closed internal navigation, declared agent messages, explicit resource-read adapter, and fetch-backed multiplexed SSE wake decoder |
| `auth.ts` | one-way authentication transition shared by every 401 handler |
| `api.ts` | ordered same-origin BFF calls and CSRF rotation |
| `types.ts` | TypeScript snapshot and mutation response shapes |
| `styles.css` | responsive work-focused visual system with accessible type-scale tokens |

## Testing And Conformance

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `mcp/conformance` | reusable domain-neutral MCP certification library, thin CLI, schemas, profiles, authenticated same-origin well-known-surface checks, live declaration binding, and standalone image |
| `testing/smoke/src/bin/smoke.rs` | smoke command dispatcher and digest-addressed simulation certification entrypoint |
| `testing/smoke/src/bin/smoke/scenarios/` | Rust process/deployment scenarios |
| `testing/smoke/src/bin/smoke/support/` | process, HTTP, auth, fixture, usage helpers |
| `testing/smoke/tests/` | static deployment/offline contract tests |
| component-local `tests/` | focused live SurrealDB and service integration tests |
| `testing/local-test-report.json` | committed informational result of checks executed on the qualified development host, bound to product build inputs rather than documentation-only content |
| `.github/workflows/local-test-report.yml` | lightweight presentation of the committed local test report; it performs no substantive build, deployment, GPU, or browser acceptance |

There should be no smoke lifecycle, retry, assertion, or cleanup logic in shell recipes.

## Change Routing

- Change shared identity/policy/artifact semantics in `mcp/contract`, then update the
  platform store and every affected boundary.
- Change persistence shape in `platform/store` with an ordered migration and matching Rust API.
- Change durable task lifecycle and its official MCP projection in
  `platform/task-runtime`; hosted handlers use `rmcp` Task types directly.
- Change a domain tool schema in its owning `servers/*-mcp` server, not the gateway.
- Change MCP Apps protocol constants or helpers in `mcp/apps-extension`; app views live beside
  their server (`servers/{server}-mcp/assets/`), and the console host surface in
  `apps/console/bff` (`apps.rs`) plus `apps/console/web/src/apps/`.
- Change a domain administrative surface in its owning server as scope-gated MCP tools and
  resources, and represent it in the browser through the server's MCP App view — never a
  bespoke admin REST router, BFF proxy route, or hardcoded console page.
- Change browser behavior through `apps/console/bff` plus `apps/console/web`; do not expose gateway
  tokens to JavaScript.
- Change Recording Explorer bulk projection delivery through
  `apps/console/web/src/apps/recordingProjectionStream.ts`. Only the exact Recording
  Explorer may receive its transferable stream.
- Change public routes in Helm ingress, then extend the Rust deployment smoke.
- Change installation image/config content in Helm, the offline lock/builder, and
  deployment contract together.
- Deliver install-time domain configuration through the generic `serverBootstrap` values only
  when the owning server defines an installation-time contract. Frames worlds are runtime MCP
  state and must never be placed in Helm bootstrap.
