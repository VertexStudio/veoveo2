# Veoveo Technical Design

This document explains how the self-hosted Veoveo components implement the
boundaries in `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`. The architecture is protocol-first.
Known requests, responses, identities, and persisted records use explicit Rust types
or declared schemas. Durable state and service ownership remain inside the installation.

## Standards And Protocols

This table is the cross-component protocol contract. Domain design documents narrow
the data standards they implement; the root README provides the shorter product-level
catalog.

| Standard or protocol | Technical boundary |
|---|---|
| [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) | Version `2026-07-28`; JSON-RPC 2.0 over stateless Streamable HTTP at client-to-gateway and gateway-to-server boundaries. Per-request metadata and `server/discover` replace protocol sessions. Ordinary responses use JSON; `subscriptions/listen` owns request-scoped event streams. |
| [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/) | Complete bounded MCP tool input schemas generated from Rust or Python types. Local references and composition are supported; remote references are rejected. Controlled persisted and structured-result models use the same typed vocabulary. |
| MCP Tasks extension `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` | Version `2026-07-28`; durable task creation, discovery, lifecycle updates, cancellation, terminal payloads, and subscriptions use official MCP messages rather than a job REST API. |
| [MCP Apps SEP-1865](../mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md) | `ext-apps` version `2026-01-26`; server-owned `ui://` resources use the sandboxed MCP Apps host bridge. |
| OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 | OIDC Core login; S256 PKCE; Client Credentials and JWT Bearer grants; RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata; RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata; RFC 8707 resource indicators; signed JWT/JWS/JWK tokens and key discovery. |
| MCP Enterprise-Managed Authorization / ID-JAG | Explicit enterprise grant profile with durable replay protection, client binding, tenant mapping, and scope reduction. |
| HTTPS and HTTP range semantics | External acquisition, MCP transport, provider webhooks, and artifact delivery. Internal cleartext HTTP exists only inside declared cluster trust boundaries. |
| OpenTelemetry OTLP/HTTP | Optional traces and logs from shared server instrumentation. Export remains disabled unless the installation supplies an endpoint. |
| Veoveo recording ingest | Version `2026-08-06`; authenticated protobuf batches and distinct Blueprint publications preserve native Rerun 0.36.3 stores, ordering, idempotency, decoder-safe rollover markers, and policy-scoped single-recording replacement. |
| Rerun 0.36.3 gRPC, RRD, Rerun Data Protocol, and `VideoStream` | Producer-local log ingestion, immutable time-and-space records, recording-scoped lazy viewer playback, and H.264 Annex B video with exact timeline indices. |
| S3-compatible object API | Private Artifact service storage only. The bundled store uses digest-pinned RustFS `1.0.0-rc.3`, the latest published non-preview release candidate because RustFS has no stable release. SurrealDB remains authoritative for occurrences, identity, grants, release state, shares, policy, and audit. Client delivery uses HTTP streaming and byte ranges through the installation origin. |
| NVIDIA cuOpt 26.08 and CUDA 13.3 | Digest-pinned hardware-GPU execution for heterogeneous routing, BatchSolve scenarios, continuous LP/QP/QCQP/SOCP, and linear MILP. `veoveo.io/travel-model-artifact/v1` is the repository-owned Map handoff; `veoveo.io/cuopt-executor/v1` is a private pod-local adapter protocol rather than a public contract. |
| Kubernetes, Helm, and OCI images | Canonical workload graph, declarative installation configuration, registry-first delivery, GitOps reconciliation, and offline bundle material. |
| Domain standards | Map, Optimization, Time, Frames, View, UAV, Recording, Perception, and Reason designs pin their geospatial, solver, temporal, 3D, vehicle, and media profiles independently. |

## Capability Model

The normative server contract, including the need-to-surface mapping every
hosted server follows, is [`mcp/contract/DESIGN.md`](../mcp/contract/DESIGN.md).
This section describes how the gateway projects that contract.

The gateway discovers these surfaces from upstream servers and projects them into a
profile. It prefixes tool names only at the aggregation boundary, for example local
`run` becomes `media__run`. Resource URIs keep their owning scheme.

Discovery failure has a profile-selected mode. The default isolates the failing
server: it drops out of the aggregated projection and typed degradation metadata
reports the gap. A profile may instead declare `fail_closed` discovery, where any
unavailable hosted server fails the whole tool list, so an autonomous client can
never retain a silently incomplete toolset.

Each catalog entry declares two typed upstream URLs: the MCP endpoint and a
required health endpoint. The gateway probes `health_url` with an unauthenticated
GET and treats only a success status as healthy; it never reads an MCP request, an
authentication failure, or a method rejection as a health signal. Health state
feeds the Console without entering discovery for failure-isolating profiles.

### Tool input schemas

The canonical schema profile is normative in
[`mcp/contract/DESIGN.md`](../mcp/contract/DESIGN.md#schemas-and-types): one
JSON Schema 2020-12 document per tool input with an object root, no references,
and immediate types, preserving the full typed contract while keeping argument
shapes visible to clients that inspect a property without resolving schema
references.

Rust servers import `tool` from `veoveo_mcp_contract`. The macro selects the shared
Schemars generator for every `Parameters<T>` handler and supplies the closed empty-object
schema for handlers without arguments. Tagged Rust enums declare their object or string
type on the domain type itself. Python servers pass each Pydantic request model through
`veoveo_mcp.schema.mcp_input_schema` before publishing it.

Recursive tool arguments are outside this profile because a finite self-contained
schema cannot express unbounded recursion without references. Domain contracts model
bounded collections explicitly. Servers deserialize the structured value described by
the schema; the gateway does not rewrite schemas or convert JSON-encoded strings.

The MCP conformance client's `info` command validates every advertised tool schema
against its declared dialect and enforces this client-facing shape.

Tasks-capable MCP clients use the official Tasks methods directly through a gateway profile.
The gateway routes task-augmented tool calls, get, update, cancel, and subscriptions to
the owning server without changing the canonical task identity. It applies profile
exposure, ownership, policy, audit, and resource-URI projection at that boundary. The
standard MCP task surface is an additive projection over the same upstream extension
for clients that negotiate it.

Some registered clients are explicitly `tools_compat`. Their narrow projections are
implemented over the same upstream operation contract, task ID, policy decision, audit
path, subscription, artifact identity, and result. Task projection for these clients
requires the explicit direct-adapter flag. Compatibility behavior remains additive and
does not create a second protocol or source of truth. Full-MCP clients never receive
compatibility helper clutter.

The gateway declares tool, prompt, and resource list-change support independently. Each
claim follows the exact upstream capability and no generic notification switch exists.
Servers and the gateway await delivery through the owning session in protocol order.
A two-second delivery bound prevents an unresponsive client from holding the handler
indefinitely without detaching work after its session ends. A new authenticated session
always receives the current policy-filtered catalog.

Every logical MCP endpoint has one active process. Helm renders the gateway, hosted MCP
servers, and local stdio bridges with one replica and `Recreate`. Stdio exists only
between the bridge and the child whose lifecycle it owns. Legacy HTTP+SSE and network
stdio are not registration choices. Independently stateless services, including the
Console BFF and artifact byte service, retain their own replica configuration.

Client hosts may retain their own per-user tool permissions after OAuth grants change.
Those permissions are outside gateway authority: reconnecting authentication refreshes
identity and scopes, but it does not necessarily reset the host's selected tools. After
an installation expands a profile, operators refresh the connector's tool permissions
or reinstall the connector when its host does not ingest the changed catalog. A new
conversation then loads the updated selection. The gateway continues to enforce every
tool call independently of the host's selection.

Binary entrypoints parse configuration, initialize dependencies, assemble routers, and

tool schemas stay in the server that owns them.

## Hosted Server Administration

A hosted server owns one domain contract under its catalog identity. MCP is the
canonical surface for domain reads, mutations, durable work, and interactive App
views:

```text
MCP client or MCP App host
  -> gateway MCP profile
  -> {server mount}/mcp
  -> typed tools, resources, tasks, and notifications

accepted administrative API client
  -> gateway /admin/{profile}/servers/{server}/{*path}
  -> {server mount}/admin/{path}
  -> additive projection over the same domain models and state
```

Every domain administrative tool or resource enters through the normal gateway MCP
profile. The gateway applies the selected server's method and target policy, records the
operation, and forwards the caller's short-lived internal assertion. Long-running
administrative work uses the shared Task API.

An accepted HTTP projection is optional and explicit in the owning design. The gateway
reads the active catalog revision, requires the selected profile to contain the server,
classifies the projected method as `AdminRead` or `AdminWrite`, and applies the same
policy and audit path. The proxy preserves the bounded request body and the headers
needed for typed content, idempotency, conditional writes, caching, and retry guidance.

The owning server validates the internal assertion and the domain's administrative
scope. Projection handlers reuse the canonical MCP request and response models and the
same application state. They do not introduce alternate identities or persistence.
Durable domain records live behind `veoveo-platform-store`; their ordered schema
migrations remain part of installation bootstrap.

The Console publishes explicit BFF routes for installation-wide workflows. Server-owned
browser workflows are MCP Apps discovered from their canonical resources. The browser
never receives the gateway bearer. Server design documents specify their MCP
administration, persistence records, authorization scopes, App resources, and any
accepted HTTP projection.

An App can address an always-on agent only when its listed resource names that exact
target in `io.veoveo/agent-message-targets`. The opaque frame sends a closed UUIDv7 and
bounded-text request through the host bridge. Console then uses its existing authenticated
human-message route, preserving CSRF enforcement, actor attribution, Work Context policy,
audit, idempotency, and durable wake ordering without exposing cookies or agent authority
to the frame.

## Durable Platform Store

SurrealDB `3.2.4` is the only platform coordination store; the Rust client pins the
compatible `3.2.4` release. The canonical release uses
one RocksDB-backed node. Installation bootstrap connects at root scope, applies ordered
migrations, creates or rotates the database runtime user, and publishes the initial
gateway control revision. Long-running services connect at database scope and never run
migrations themselves.

`veoveo-platform-store` owns Rust record types and persistence APIs for:

- tenants, principals, groups, server/profile identities, and policies;
- Work Contexts, invocation authority, ownership defaults, and access requests;
- immutable gateway control revisions and the active revision pointer;
- access tokens, refresh families/tokens, authorization state, ID-JAG replay state, and
  JWT revocations;
- tasks, owners, leases, results, retention pins, provider jobs/events, and usage;
- artifact blobs, occurrences, grants, share links, and write capabilities;
- coordinate frames/operations, recording datasets/layers, agents/episodes/wakes;
- audit events and the transactional outbox.

Cross-process state changes write their domain record and outbox event in one
transaction. Consumers checkpoint an outbox cursor. SurrealDB LIVE delivery may reduce
latency, but reconnect always reconciles from the durable cursor because LIVE ordering
and delivery are not the authority.

DuckDB is not used for platform coordination. It remains the domain runtime for
arbitrary analytical SQL and local agent analysis.

## Durable Task Runtime

`veoveo-task-runtime` is protocol-neutral. It owns UUIDv7 task creation, idempotency,
leases, claims, progress, input requests, cancellation, terminal results, retention,
recovery, and outbox transitions. Tenant, principal, profile, server, and operation are
part of idempotency scope.

Official MCP Tasks `2026-07-28` are projected directly by `rmcp` handlers:
discovery, task-required tool invocation, get, update, cancel, and event-stream task
subscriptions. Each handler projects the shared runtime's task snapshots; it does not persist a
parallel task model. Traits use native Rust return-position `impl Future`; the workspace
does not require `async-trait` for controlled async contracts.

Each durable operation declares one recovery class:

- `Resume`: deterministic and side-effect-safe. A new worker may reclaim an expired
  lease and continue from persisted request/capability state.
- `WebhookWait`: an external provider job was durably submitted and now waits for its
  signed callback.
- `InterruptedIndeterminate`: execution may have caused a mutation. Recovery marks the
  task failed and never repeats the operation.

Long-running servers use this same runtime: media, timeseries, optimization, frames, map,
Time, DuckDB, and SUMO. There is no server-local in-memory task registry and no alternate
task URI.

## Provider Completion

The media server keeps client/server async and provider/server async separate:

1. A live gateway identity creates a durable task and bounded artifact write capability.
2. Provider submission and the provider-job binding commit before the server reports
   successful detachment.
3. The task enters `WebhookWait`.
4. The provider sends a signed terminal webhook.
5. The server durably records the unique event, redeems the preissued artifact
   capability, stores usage, commits the terminal task result, and emits outbox events.

The one active media MCP process receives callbacks. Duplicate signed events are
idempotent, and restart recovery replays durable unprocessed events. Provider CDN URLs
and opaque payloads are not returned to clients. Missing webhook delivery is an
operational failure; no timeout path queries provider status.

Cancellation is intentionally asymmetric. `tasks/cancel` commits the local cancellation
first, then durably records a best-effort provider deletion request and its accepted,
not-deleted, failed, or timed-out outcome. Provider deletion acknowledgement is not treated
as proof of compute stoppage or a refund. If a signed terminal webhook arrives later, it is
authoritative for the provider-job state and triggers actual billing reconciliation. The
cancelled task remains terminal: webhook processing does not fetch provider outputs, redeem
the artifact write capability, create artifacts, or replace the task result. Completion
still has no provider-status polling path.

## Artifact Plane

An artifact occurrence has a fresh opaque UUIDv7 and canonical `artifact://{id}` URI.
The content hash verifies integrity and enables tenant-local deduplication. Storage keys
include tenant identity, so equal content across tenants never aliases.

Every occurrence also retains its Work Context, producer, invocation provenance,
policy revision, output owner, and initial grants. The gateway derives that authority
from authenticated identity and the active control-plane revision. Domain services
receive it in the signed internal assertion and cannot replace it with caller-supplied
ownership or provenance.

The artifact service composes:

- hard tenant isolation;
- mandatory data-label clearance;
- user/group discretionary grants with ordered `read < write < admin` levels;
- retention and release state;
- gateway policy at the external route;
- service-side authorization using the forwarded gateway identity.

Domain servers cannot mint background identities. Async output uses a capability issued
while the live principal was present. The capability is task-bound, size-bounded,
expiring, single-purpose, and redeemed with an idempotency key.

Sharing modes are intentionally separate:

- Authorized sharing creates a user or group grant. Group role caps grant level, and
  label clearance can never be widened by a grant.
- Public sharing first requires `releasable` or `released`, then creates a read-only
  random bearer. Only its hash is stored. Expiry is at most thirty days, optional
  download limits are atomic, and revocation is immediate.

A caller who satisfies tenancy and clearance can request discretionary access when
need-to-know is the remaining denial. Context custodians and owners can inspect the
review queue. Artifact `admin` authority is required for a decision, and approval
creates the direct grant in the same SurrealDB transaction that closes the request.
The Console projects the exact service decision, its contributing sources, and the
artifact's retained provenance.

The complete model and enterprise mapping guidance are in
[`WORK_CONTEXT_GOVERNANCE.md`](WORK_CONTEXT_GOVERNANCE.md).

Authorized browser downloads enter through
`/artifacts/{profile}/{artifact_id}/download`. The gateway evaluates policy, records
audit evidence, issues a short-lived internal assertion, and streams the Artifact
service response with backpressure. Console downloads use
`/console/api/artifacts/{artifact_id}/download` through the BFF. Full downloads, HEAD,
and one HTTP byte range preserve content headers without exposing a storage address.
Public bearer redemption is the only `/s/{token}` route. Domain-specific artifact byte
paths do not exist.

Every client-facing path uses the one origin selected by `global.publicBaseUrl`.
Object storage has no ingress, public endpoint, DNS name, or presigned client URL.
RustFS accepts cluster traffic only from Artifact service and bucket initialization.

Because the public path contains a bearer, edge access/APM/WAF logs must suppress
`/s/*`. Helm renders `/s` as a dedicated Ingress whose default ingress-nginx
annotation disables access logging; installations using another controller must
replace it with that controller's equivalent. Application audit events never
record the raw token.

## DuckDB Runtime

DuckDB accepts arbitrary SQL for `query` and `execute`; a restricted query builder would
remove the intended analytical value. Isolation is applied around the engine:

- database files are derived from authenticated owner identity;
- the server has one serialized owner/workspace boundary and a persistent singleton PVC
  in Helm;
- configuration and extension loading are locked before user SQL;
- the official DuckDB Spatial extension matching the embedded DuckDB version is
  pinned into the image, verified at startup, and loaded before that lock;
- memory, threads, spill, execution time, result rows, and result bytes are bounded;
- external sources require governed ingest, artifact resolution, or explicitly allowed
  HTTPS attachment;
- export bytes enter the shared artifact plane through a task capability;
- container capabilities, writable paths, process count, and network reach are limited.

Spatial geometry, CRS, R-tree, and MVT functions remain analytical SQL. DuckDB does
not become the tile, style, or map-rendering service merely because it can compute
geometries and vector-tile blobs.

Read-only query and export tasks use `Resume`. Mutating execute and ingest tasks use
`InterruptedIndeterminate` once execution may have started. This preserves flexibility
without pretending mutations can be replayed safely.

## Map And Optimization Decision Plane

Map constructs immutable travel models from one governed release, mobility-profile
version, and restriction snapshot. A travel model fixes controlled location and
vehicle-type order, cost and transit-time units, unavailable arcs, and provenance.
Optimization resolves that exact Map-owned occurrence through the artifact plane.

The Optimization control container accepts typed routing, route-scenario, continuous
LP/QP/QCQP/SOCP, and linear MILP inputs. It validates stable identifiers and every
cross-reference, combines sparse terms, applies bounded solver profiles, and writes a
digest-checked prepared problem. One serialized admission queue sends the prepared
problem over the private length-prefixed Unix-socket protocol to the Python executor.

The executor owns the CUDA context and bounded RMM pool inside the pinned cuOpt image.
It exposes no cluster Service and carries no tenant, policy, artifact, or durable-task
authority. Readiness requires the expected cuOpt version and a visible NVIDIA GPU.

Completed output returns to Rust for independent route feasibility, bound, integrality,
constraint, and objective checks. The server publishes immutable
`optimization://problem`, `optimization://run`, and `optimization://solution`
resources plus verification evidence. A caller can invoke `verify_solution` again with
an allowed tolerance without rerunning cuOpt.

## Gateway Identity And Policy

External identity is provider-independent. The control-plane configuration is validated
against its schema. It describes the OIDC issuer, JWKS, claim mapping, tenant mapping,
authorization endpoints, clients, profiles, scopes, server exposure, and policy rules.
Keycloak is used for real integration tests; Entra is shown in the Bioma example.

Interactive login derives a bounded display label from the verified OIDC `name`,
`preferred_username`, or `email` claim in that order. The stable subject supplies a
compact fallback. This label travels beside the immutable principal through the
authorization code, signed access token, and rotating refresh grant. It never replaces
issuer, subject, principal id, tenant, Work Context membership, or any policy input.

The gateway supports:

- protected-resource and authorization-server metadata;
- authorization code with PKCE;
- client credentials and client assertions;
- MCP Enterprise-Managed Authorization / ID-JAG;
- profile/resource-bound signed access tokens;
- durable rotating refresh tokens, bounded duplicate delivery, family replay detection,
  revocation, audit, and GC;
- per-method and target-aware policy checks;
- Ed25519 internal assertions with `kid`, issuer, audience, principal, tenant, labels,
  scopes, and short expiry.

Unknown profiles, servers, methods, resources, task IDs, artifact IDs, issuers, keys, or
policy targets fail closed. Audit records carry explicit principal attributes and decision
context but exclude prompts, artifact bytes, provider payloads, tokens, link bearers,
webhook bodies, and signed URLs.

Server-owned resource projection namespaces a server's Apps and opaque upstream resource
schemes. A manifest declares `referenced_resource_schemes` when its typed outputs carry
canonical resources owned by another registered server. Those identities pass through
unchanged; the gateway rejects declarations for schemes absent from the same control plane.

Refresh rotation is a durable compare-and-swap. The winner stores only an
XChaCha20-Poly1305 successor envelope for the configured short delivery window. Its AAD
binds the authorization server, profile, OAuth client, token family, and generation. A
concurrent request using the just-consumed token receives that exact successor and an audit
event with reason code `refresh_token_duplicate_delivery`. Once the window expires, reuse is
delayed replay and revokes the whole family. The delivery key is a separate base64-encoded 32-byte
installation secret; plaintext tokens and delivery envelopes never enter logs, audit
payloads, outbox events, or console snapshots. The envelope becomes ineligible for
delivery at the configured deadline. Consuming that successor clears its envelope in
the same transaction; otherwise a dedicated one-minute GC removes expired ciphertext.

Gateway runtime and admin modules use the same policy/audit path. Console task
cancellation calls the owning server's official Tasks endpoint; it never edits task rows.
Artifact release/grant/link mutations call the artifact service; the console snapshot is
only a safe projection and never includes token hashes or reusable link URLs.

## Console Browser Boundary

`console-bff` is the only browser session boundary. It performs gateway OAuth login with
PKCE, stores access and rotating refresh tokens in an XChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted,
HttpOnly, SameSite cookie, and uses a separate encrypted authorization cookie during
login. Unsafe requests require a constant-time CSRF token match.

The OAuth protected-resource URL remains a public identity even when the BFF reaches
the gateway through a cluster-private transport URL. The Apps MCP client binds those
URLs by their exact `/mcp/<profile>` path and sends the public deployment authority as
`Host` on the internal connection. Installation CA roots augment the platform trust
store for every outbound BFF client; unreadable or invalid trust material prevents
startup.

The React application receives installation projections and one-time share URLs, never a
gateway bearer. CSP, frame denial, MIME sniff prevention, same-origin referrer policy,
and no-store API responses are applied by the BFF. The installation snapshot is the
browser's authentication bootstrap. Catalog and live-stream requests begin only after
that bootstrap succeeds. Every unauthorized response enters one shared, non-retrying
login transition, which prevents parallel API failures from starting competing OAuth
flows.

The snapshot carries a trusted display name for every principal it projects, with
authenticated identity metadata taking precedence over the store projection. The
Console renders those labels across the topbar, access, agents, and artifact views,
keeps the canonical principal id in tooltips for operational diagnostics, and
compacts an unresolved principal's identifier rather than inventing a name.

Recording playback remains inside this boundary. The BFF exposes authorized same-origin
manifest and bounded-live routes, while the gateway evaluates the canonical
`recording://` resource policy and audits every access. The manifest grants one
recording-scoped, host-limited Redap read session. The browser then reaches the same-origin
read-only Rerun service directly and fetches only the footer-indexed chunks required by
the active view. The browser lazily loads the Rerun viewer version that matches the RRD
producer. Artifact previews use a separate inline route and keep text reads bounded.

## Recordings And Agents

The Recording Hub is a push-based durability service. Producers send native Rerun log
messages to a loopback forwarder. The forwarder obtains an OAuth client-credentials token
and uploads bounded, sequenced protobuf batches through the gateway. It begins a batch at
each H.264 video sample. Hub admits a rollover boundary only when the first access unit
contains SPS, PPS, and IDR. Public, local-network, and Kubernetes traffic use this same
resource and protocol.

The hub validates each complete Rerun payload, fsyncs it into a deterministic journal,
and advances its SurrealDB checkpoint only after the journal rename is durable. One
ordered materializer compacts hour-or-192-MiB input windows with Rerun's object-store
profile, aligns video rollover to a decoder-reentrant batch, writes the footer manifest,
and publishes immutable RRD archive shards under the stream's authenticated tenant,
owner, dataset, classification, and labels. Raw Rerun ingest, durable parts, and
filesystem paths are not installation ingress or read surfaces.

`recording-mcp` applies tenant/label authorization to discovery, query, subscription,
artifact publication, playback-session creation, and bounded-history live following.
It projects immutable shards as layers of one recording-scoped Redap dataset segment and
rewrites the live tail to that same identity. Console presents both in one persistent
Rerun timeline without downloading every shard or constructing another RRD. SUMO uses
the same path: one serialized TraCI owner publishes Rerun world frames and exposes
traffic controls, resources, and tasks.

The agent kernel runs bounded episodes and persists scheduling through
`veoveo-agent-runtime`. Tool tasks detach at episode end; durable descriptors, watcher
leases, retry schedules, retention pins, results, and wakes survive process restart.
The gateway route retains the protocol's opaque upstream Task ID and, for a
first-party shared-runtime Task, a strong record reference. The consuming episode
verifies every claimed wake, releases that Task's retention pin, marks the delivery
consumed, acknowledges the wakes, and writes the outbox receipt in one SurrealDB
transaction. Outbox/changefeed events wake the next episode. DuckDB and RRD are
analytical memory planes; chat history is not the source of truth.

The periodic scheduler heartbeat proves that the durable wake path is alive. A
heartbeat-only batch is acknowledged under the agent lease without starting an LLM
episode. Operator messages, task results, resource changes, answered input requests,
and explicit timers remain actionable wakes; if one coalesces with a heartbeat, the
batch runs an ordinary bounded episode.

Agent manifests separate the Gateway's canonical public origin from its physical
HTTP transport origin. OAuth audience and protected-resource identity use the
canonical origin, while an in-cluster agent may connect through a private service
address. Both values are required bare HTTP(S) origins. The kernel preserves the
canonical HTTP authority across the private transport. Every manifest string supports
fail-closed `${VAR}` deployment substitution before typed decoding and validation. One
reviewed manifest can therefore instantiate isolated identities without generating
installation-specific copies. A manifest may also declare a bounded set of absolute MCP
resource URIs that wake the agent on change. During token
rotation, the kernel connects the replacement session and restores the complete
subscription set before publishing its connection epoch; a failed subscription leaves
the prior authenticated session active. Every MCP request performs the same serialized
freshness check before dispatch, so concurrent callers cannot publish competing
epochs. The current epoch also provides one governed resource-read tool. It admits
bounded text and JSON under episode-local read, family, byte, wall-time, and pagination
limits, and it projects only fixed correction fields for invalid input. Protocol,
authorization, transport, and storage details do not enter model context.

Authenticated user and service control stays available through the gateway, while the
Console BFF carries the signed-in browser path; the agent pod is never an ingress
service. Every caller must pass the selected profile's action policy. An operator
message is committed as a UUIDv7-idempotent durable wake inside the caller's exact
tenant, Work Context, and tenant-unique public agent key, so it may arrive while an
episode or detached task is running. The agent record's profile governs its own MCP tool
session; the caller's administrative profile never replaces it during target resolution.
Console snapshots and change events identify that target by its tenant-scoped symbolic
`agent_key`, which is the same identifier accepted by every control route; internal
SurrealDB record keys never become public control identities. The snapshot also carries
the current runner-lease deadline. Console projects an absent or expired lease as
offline at that exact deadline without polling or changing durable episode state.
Elicitation decisions use the same governed path and durable record. The kernel opens a
SurrealDB live-query hint before rereading that record, which closes the subscribe/read
race without status polling. A decision that arrives after the bounded in-episode wait
becomes a new wake instead of being lost. Messages and answers remain untrusted,
actor-attributed input; downstream domain policy still decides whether a proposed
change may take effect.

## Deployment

Helm defines the canonical Kubernetes service graph. k3d runs that chart locally
with loopback ingress and profile-owned values.

Helm separates bootstrap and runtime database Secrets, emits default-deny network policy,
supports an existing object store and SIEM credentials, can require strict Istio mTLS,
uses persistent RWO storage for the singleton DuckDB server, and keeps recording ingest
internal. SurrealDB HA is not claimed.

The offline builder resolves digest-pinned external images, builds exact-tag Veoveo
images, exports configuration schemas, records image identities, emits SPDX SBOMs and
checksums, and packages Helm configuration. The loader verifies all files before
import, verifies image references after import, retains evidence, and performs no network
operation.

## Hardware-Backed GPU And Visual Execution

GPU workloads request their required Kubernetes resources and fail readiness when the
accelerator or coherent runtime is unavailable. Optimization additionally checks the
pinned cuOpt version and hardware GPU during sidecar startup; it has no CPU solver.
Browser visual acceptance runs in a headed browser and probes both WebGPU and WebGL
when they are exposed. At least one high-performance path must report hardware backing.
SwiftShader, llvmpipe, software adapters, and software rasterizer warnings fail the
visual workflow.

The Stream App queries Media Capabilities for the exact H.264 codec, dimensions,
bitrate, and frame rate. A supported and smooth configuration may use browser software
decode when `powerEfficient` is false, but the App labels it as software H.264 decode.
Hardware decode is claimed only when `powerEfficient` is true. Browser graphics and all
server-side GPU work remain hardware-backed in either case.

## Verification

All smoke orchestration is Rust. The harness owns child/container lifecycle, readiness,
timeouts, cleanup, MCP and HTTP calls, assertions, and evidence. `cargo xtask smoke`
only builds the harness and its scenario-specific local binary prerequisites, then
dispatches the typed scenario.

Coverage includes:

- real SurrealDB 3.2 migration/runtime credentials and multi-process durability;
- gateway OAuth, Keycloak login, refresh rotation/replay, internal assertions, policy,
  admin operations, audit, task and artifact projection;
- webhook-only media completion across process restart and durable event replay;
- task recovery classes, deterministic resume output, capability redemption, quotas;
- arbitrary DuckDB SQL and interruption classification;
- recording crash recovery, rollover, catalog rebuild, and SUMO push readback;
- k3d/GPU, headed hardware browser, Helm/schema, offline manifest/loader, and console
  build contracts.

The complete behavior matrix is executable from `testing/smoke` and the focused crate
tests; documentation is not used as evidence in place of those checks.
