# Local deployment profiles

Typed deployment profiles are a repository-development convenience for disposable
showcases. They select Docker Bake groups, a local k3d cluster, development Secrets,
and local Helm charts. Enterprise installations use the OCI and GitOps contract in
[Enterprise deployment](ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md).

The current complete profile is the SUMO development environment:

| Concern | Canonical owner |
|---|---|
| Image definitions and reusable groups | docker-bake.hcl |
| Local image destination | Profile-selected registry host and port with revision-addressed image tags |
| Platform workload graph | deploy/helm/veoveo |
| Showcase workload graph | Its adjacent Helm chart |
| Development composition | A `veoveo.io/deployment/v6` installation-repository JSON profile |
| Local registry lifecycle | deploy/local/k3d/registry.json |

## Workflow

Commit source before publishing. The publisher resolves the requested revision to a
full commit SHA and moves a locked persistent publication worktree to that commit.
Unchanged source paths retain their metadata, while local edits cannot change bytes
published under another revision.

~~~bash
PROFILE=showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json
LOCK=output/deployments/sumo/deployment.lock.json
REVISION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

cargo xtask smoke profile-validate --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-up --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask release images \
  --profile "$PROFILE" \
  --profile-revision "$REVISION" \
  --lock-output "$LOCK"
cargo xtask smoke profile-up --profile "$PROFILE" --lock "$LOCK"
~~~

A profile whose `gatewayActivation` declares `generatedPublicFiles` (see
[Generated public files](#generated-public-files)) needs `profile-cluster-up` to have
generated that material at least once in the current checkout before `profile-validate`
can fully evaluate the gateway activation; run `profile-cluster-up` first, or expect
`profile-validate` to fail naming the missing generated file. `profile-up` and
`release images` are unaffected by this ordering: `profile-up` generates the material
itself if it is still missing, and `release images` never reads it.

BuildKit pushes images directly to the profile-selected OCI registry. It does not load
release images into the host Docker image store. The publisher configures the managed
builder from `registry.pushAddress` and `registry.transport`. Kubernetes receives
`registry.pullAddress`. An insecure development registry may use different host and
cluster authorities for the same content store. Ordinary local builds preserve the
registry-capable builder state and cache.

The exact typed platform closure runs as one multi-target Bake invocation. Bake retains
the shared dependency graph and Cargo family consolidation inside that invocation.
Workload and extension sources publish their repository-owned groups as separate
phases.

Each compatible Rust family compiles its selected binaries in one Cargo invocation.
Target caches derive from source identity, builder family, platform, and profile.
Builders with a different operating-system ABI or native SDK use separate identities.

## Contract

Installation-owned paths resolve relative to the profile. Source-owned chart and values
paths resolve inside that source's exact checkout. The fields are:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| schemaVersion | `veoveo.io/deployment/v6` |
| name | Stable local environment identity |
| registry.pushAddress | OCI host and port reachable from the publication host |
| registry.pullAddress | OCI host and port reachable from Kubernetes nodes |
| registry.transport | `tls` or explicitly admitted `insecure-http` |
| registry.localConfig | Shared k3d registry definition |
| sources | Named repositories with `platform`, `workload`, or `extension` ownership and independent revisions |
| sources[].imageGroups | Ordered source-owned phases for workload and extension sources; prohibited on the platform source |
| sources[].releases[].sourceValues | Helm values resolved from the exact source checkout |
| sources[].releases[].installationValues | Later Helm overrides resolved from the installation repository |
| kubernetes.context | Explicit kubectl and Helm context |
| kubernetes.localCluster | k3d configuration and node bootstrap manifests |
| namespace | Namespace for local resources |
| resources.manifests | Kubernetes resources applied before Helm |
| resources.configMaps | File-backed development ConfigMaps |
| resources.secrets | Environment-backed development Secrets |
| gatewayActivation.controlPlane | Complete installation-owned composed gateway document |
| gatewayActivation.publicFiles | Exact public JWKS and CA files referenced by that document, resolved from a committed installation-repository path |
| gatewayActivation.generatedPublicFiles | Public files referenced by that document but produced by a local-cluster lifecycle command instead of a committed path; see [Generated public files](#generated-public-files) |
| gatewayActivation.confidentialSecret | Pre-existing Secret that `profile-up` verifies but never rewrites |
| gatewayActivation.requiredSecretKeys | Secret data keys required before gateway rollout |
| platform | Typed installation preset or exact components, MCP servers, and artifact audiences |
| platform.gpuScheduling.allocator.installation | Exact managed NVIDIA DRA chart and image closure, eligible nodes, conflicting-device-plugin removal, and maturity acceptance |
| gatewayRequirements | Composer outputs that the selected runtime must satisfy |
| waitForDeployments | Extra rollout gates |

`cargo xtask release images --profile` accepts a profile inside another Git repository.
`--profile-revision` names that installation repository's exact commit. The command
requires the checked-out profile and every referenced installation input to match that
commit, then resolves each source revision independently.

The publisher derives only the required platform targets, rejects missing or
unnecessary platform images and duplicate repository/tag references, and executes the
platform set once. Workload and extension groups remain source-owned. It writes one
`veoveo.io/deployment-lock/v6` document with the installation revision, registry
endpoints and transport, source repositories and revisions, image manifest digests, chart-content
digests, and expanded platform graph.

`cargo xtask smoke profile-up` requires that lock. It verifies the installation
revision and referenced profile files, checks out each source at the recorded revision,
and verifies its origin, exact Bake repositories, and source-chart archive digest. Helm
receives source values followed by installation-owned overrides and the source-owned
digest map in production mode. Installation never re-resolves `HEAD`, a branch, or
another mutable source expression.

When `gatewayActivation` is present, profile validation parses the control plane, checks
that its complete file reference set exactly matches the union of `publicFiles` and
`generatedPublicFiles`, and validates each JWKS or CA bundle. Profile application
verifies the confidential Secret keys, creates a digest-named immutable ConfigMap, and
supplies that name and digest to the platform release. A repeated application reuses
the same revision, while a changed public input is fully installed before Helm starts
the replacement gateway.

### Generated public files

A `gatewayActivation.publicFiles` entry is a committed installation-repository path:
`cargo xtask release images --profile-revision` and `profile-up` both require its bytes
to be Git-tracked and byte-identical to the locked revision, because that is what makes
a deployment lock reproducible from a clean checkout. Local material with no stable
committed form — the CA for a disposable local Keycloak identity provider, generated
fresh per checkout because its signing key is never persisted — cannot honor that
contract and must not be forced into it (no `git add -f`, no versioned CA, no versioned
key).

`gatewayActivation.generatedPublicFiles` is the explicit, typed escape hatch for exactly
this case. Each entry declares a `kind` from a closed set of local generators (currently
`local_keycloak_ca`); it never carries a path. The concrete on-disk location and the
generator that produces it are owned by the lifecycle tooling in
`testing/smoke/src/bin/smoke/deployment.rs`, not by the profile or by `deploy/contract`.
Validation enforces:

- `generatedPublicFiles` is valid only on a profile with `kubernetes.localCluster`; a
  profile without a local cluster cannot declare one.
- A key cannot appear in both `publicFiles` and `generatedPublicFiles`.
- The union of both key sets must exactly match the control plane's JWKS and CA
  references, exactly as it already did for `publicFiles` alone.
- `generatedPublicFiles` entries are never part of `installation_inputs()`, so they
  never enter the `release images` or `profile-up` Git-tracked reproducibility checks
  that cover every other installation input, and `release images` succeeds from a clean
  checkout of the locked revision even though the CA does not exist yet there.

Local material lifecycle is explicit, not implicit in profile loading:

- `profile-cluster-up` generates each declared kind if missing (idempotent — an existing,
  valid file is reused) and then reconciles the local service that depends on it (for
  `local_keycloak_ca`, the `k3d-veoveo-keycloak` container).
- `profile-up` ensures the same material exists before it builds the gateway activation
  ConfigMap, so its digest always incorporates the real generated bytes. Running
  `profile-up` against a profile with `generatedPublicFiles` implicitly generates
  missing material the same way `profile-cluster-up` does; there is no separate
  fail-with-a-message mode, because ensuring the material is the lifecycle-consistent
  choice and the material itself never affects reproducibility.
- `profile-cluster-stop` never generates material.
- `profile-cluster-delete` never generates material; it removes whatever already exists.
- `profile-validate` and every other read-only command never generate or delete
  anything. For a profile that declares `generatedPublicFiles`, this means
  `profile-validate` can only fully evaluate the gateway activation after
  `profile-cluster-up` has generated the material at least once in that checkout; before
  that, it fails with a message naming the missing file and pointing at
  `profile-cluster-up`.

The `extension-foundation` preset selects the gateway, platform store, object store,
artifact service, Artifact MCP, Frames MCP, and Recording MCP/hub. A custom selection
can add Map and Media. If a gateway fragment requires either capability and the
corresponding server is absent, profile validation fails before Helm runs.
`optimization` requires Optimization MCP and the cuOpt GPU executor. `rrd`
requires the Recording MCP and hub because that runtime owns governed RRD playback,
and adds `recording-forwarder` to the required image closure for producer-side
transport. Profile validation and publication reject a platform selection that omits a
required target or introduces an unnecessary one.

Secret values pass to Kubernetes over stdin. The JSON file contains environment
variable names, not bytes. This mechanism is confined to local development; enterprise
Secrets are projected by the owner's secret-management platform.

## Registry and GPU

One standalone OCI Distribution registry may serve several local k3d clusters. Its host
host port comes from `registry.pushAddress`; the node address comes from
`registry.pullAddress`. Both must match the local registry declaration. Nodes pull
missing layers into their containerd store through the cluster endpoint. Deleting a
cluster leaves the shared registry volume intact.

A profile without physical placement may apply the NVIDIA device-plugin bootstrap and
wait for allocatable `nvidia.com/gpu` capacity. A profile with `gpuScheduling` instead
manages the exact NVIDIA DRA dependency described in [GPU placement](GPU_PLACEMENT.md).
`profile-cluster-up` waits for a Ready node; `profile-up` verifies and installs DRA,
checks its DeviceClass and ResourceSlices, creates the durable claim, and only then
rolls out applications.

Local k3d schedulers do not share GPU allocation state. A single-GPU
workstation therefore runs one GPU-bearing profile cluster at a time. Stop a
completed profile before starting GPU acceptance in another profile; do not
remove required workloads from either profile to make them overlap.

Use the profile lifecycle commands for the SUMO environment:

~~~bash
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-stop --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-up --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-down --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-delete --profile "$PROFILE"
~~~

A new local showcase may add an image group and adjacent Helm chart, then select those
surfaces through a `workload` source. A fielded installation may keep deployment v5
selection in its private configuration repository, but it consumes published OCI
artifacts rather than building from a checkout inside the cluster.
