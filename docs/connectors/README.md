# Connector Recipes

A Veoveo installation operates beside the platforms an enterprise already
trusts. Connector recipes bring those platforms into the same agentic
surface. Each recipe is a guide a coding agent can execute: it installs the
vendor's MCP server beside the Veoveo connector, authenticates against the
platform, and proves the connection with a real call before any work depends
on it. The catalog below records the verified install surface for every
entry so an agent can begin from this table alone. Per-platform recipe files
land in this directory as each platform is exercised; the catalog is the
complete surface until they do.

Every entry was verified against vendor documentation on 2026-07-23. The MCP
ecosystem moves quickly, so re-verify an entry before relying on it and
update the date when you do.

## Two Ways To Connect

A client-side connector is the default. The coding agent adds the vendor's
server to its own MCP client configuration next to the installation's
`/mcp/{profile}` endpoint and pairs tools across both from the first
session. No cluster change is required, and the platform's own auth and
permissions continue to govern its side.

A governed upstream is the deeper integration. The vendor's server registers
in the gateway control plane as a `streamable_http` upstream, which places
it inside the installation's identity, policy, audit, and task boundary.
Servers that ship as stdio processes reach the gateway through
[`mcp/bridges/stdio`](../../mcp/bridges/stdio/), which re-exposes a child
process over streamable HTTP on an internal network. Systems still speaking
the MCP `2025-11-25` revision join through the isolated
[`mcp/bridges/legacy`](../../mcp/bridges/legacy/) connector, which keeps the
installation's own protocol surface at the current revision. Register the server and
a profile entry in the control plane document, then validate with
`cargo run -p veoveo-mcp-gateway --bin gateway -- validate --control-plane
<file>`. Choose this path for platforms whose calls should appear in the
installation's audit trail, such as databases with write access or systems
that act on the physical world.

## Catalog

Status meanings: **Official** is a vendor-published server in general
availability. **Official beta/preview** ships from the vendor with a
stability caveat. **Admin gated** means a platform administrator must enable
the surface before an agent can connect. **Community** is a maintained
third-party server, named so the provenance stays visible.

### Geospatial and Earth observation

These pair with the `map`, `frames`, `view`, and `stream` servers:
imagery tasking follows a map release, and matched traces land as governed
feature layers.

## Known Dead Ends

Do not install these. They circulate in older guides and agent training
data.

| Do not use | Why | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| `@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres` | Archived July 2025 after a SQL injection finding | `crystaldba/postgres-mcp` |
| Anthropic reference Slack and Google Maps servers | Archived | First-party remote endpoints above |
| `https://mcp.asana.com/sse` | v1 endpoint shut down May 11, 2026 | `https://mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp` |
| Opsgenie anything | Product end of life | Atlassian |
| `@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server` | Deprecated by Dynatrace | Hosted gateway endpoint above |
| `genai-toolbox` | Renamed | `googleapis/mcp-toolbox` |
| "Lattice MCP" servers | They target Lattice the HR platform, not Anduril Lattice | Nothing exists for Anduril |
| Datadog `/api/unstable/` MCP path | Superseded | `https://mcp.datadoghq.com/v1/mcp` |

## Gaps The Platform Already Fills

No recipe-grade MCP server exists for MAVLink or PX4 vehicle control, for
Rerun recordings, for Foxglove, or for OPC UA data access. The `uav-sim`,
`recording`, and `stream` servers are the governed answer to the first
three, which is worth stating plainly when a prospect asks how those systems
connect.

## Recipe Format

A platform's recipe is one file in this directory following
[`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md), written when that platform is first exercised
against a real installation. A recipe leads with the client-side install
for Claude Code, proves itself with a runnable verification step, pairs the
vendor's tools with Veoveo tools in worked prompts, and adds the governed
upstream registration when the platform warrants it. Recipes begin with read
access and widen scopes only on explicit request. Community servers say so
in the first line.
