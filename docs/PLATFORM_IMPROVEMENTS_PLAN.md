# Platform Reliability And Operability Implementation Plan

Status: the approved core and ergonomic work is implemented and deployed to the Bioma
installation. Phase 1 resolves from the immutable Rig fork commit
`1c59bf04ed474cc7bdf8aefb2882bb8fefe557f1` and has passed its hardware agent pilot.
The application release at `688d34e4ea517f2da3188a1cddc81b00162db0f7` converged through
activation `185b4bcb452df08cd3b5dd0fb70f1739c0931969`. The gateway startup repair
converged through activation `b65e70de30be73be22cd46a8cce416d83dfcb373` and both replicas
remain ready without restarts. Optional and evidence-gated tracks have not started
because their gates have not opened.

Baseline: Veoveo main `3029df8f` on 2026-08-14. The input was the reviewed client
package `veoveo-platform-improvements-2026-08-14`, containing thirteen requests and
six reference diffs. The diffs describe intent from an earlier integration snapshot.
They are not a merge series.

This plan strengthens agent recovery, resource use, deployment isolation, standalone
MCP App hosting, model configuration, GPU admission, provenance, spatial correctness,
and private dependency builds. It preserves the current provider webhook-only job
completion contract and the mandatory hardware-GPU boundary.

## Standards And Protocols

| Standard or profile | Plan boundary |
|---|---|
| Model Context Protocol `2026-07-28` | sole protocol profile for Veoveo-owned servers, the gateway, Rig, and first-party clients. Resource reads use JSON-RPC `Invalid Params` for unknown URIs and subscriptions use request-scoped `subscriptions/listen` |
| JSON-RPC 2.0 | protocol error envelope for malformed requests, unknown resources, authorization-independent invalid parameters, and internal failures that cannot produce a tool result |
| MCP Tasks extension, SEP-2663 | durable detached work, task updates, input requests, terminal results, and canonical task identities |
| MCP Apps SEP-1865 / `ext-apps` `2026-01-26` | `ui://` application resources, `text/html;profile=mcp-app`, sandboxed frames, host context, lifecycle notifications, and the `postMessage` bridge |
| Veoveo reactive App resource adapter | repository-owned projection from final MCP resource notifications to contentless App wakes. It is not part of SEP-1865 |
| JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 | closed agent, deployment, domain-reference, model, provenance, and qualified GPU-admission schemas |
| OAuth 2.1 draft 13, RFC 6750, RFC 7523, RFC 8414, RFC 8707, RFC 9207, and RFC 9728 | browser and machine authorization, `private_key_jwt`, metadata discovery, resource indicators, issuer validation, and protected-resource discovery |
| RFC 9110 | HTTP authority, header, cache, redirect, and error behavior for the BFF, gateway, and hosted servers |
| RFC 7946 | public longitude/latitude coordinate order used by Map GeoJSON and the Map-specific DuckDB Spatial axis policy |
| DuckDB 1.5.5 and its Spatial extension | typed `POINT_2D` distance path, `geometry_always_xy`, materialized scoring, and restart-stable Map analytics |
| Kubernetes/K3s 1.36.2 and Helm 4.2.3 | rendered Secret-reference closure for disposable development profiles. Helm and the installation reconciliation controller retain mutation ownership |
| Kubernetes server-side apply managed fields | optional read-only conflict diagnostics only if selected development scope passes its evidence gate. This plan does not transfer field ownership or replay Helm state |
| NVIDIA DRA Driver for GPUs 0.4.1, `resource.nvidia.com/v1beta1`, CUDA, and NVML | exact GPU identity, full-device or MIG capacity, memory admission, and hardware evidence. The repository implements only its declared qualified DRA profile |
| Docker Buildx 0.35.0, BuildKit 0.31.2, and Dockerfile frontend 1.25.0 | secret-mounted private Git credentials and trust inputs, cache isolation, SBOM, and maximum-mode provenance |
| `veoveo.io/deployment/v6` and `veoveo.io/deployment-lock/v6` | delivered disposable-development baseline. This plan reserves no successor version. An approved evidence-gated profile change uses the next version available when it lands |
| `veoveo.io/image-build-plan/v2` and `veoveo.io/image-build-run/v2` | current typed image plan and execution evidence. Credential source paths and bytes never enter either document |

Every dependency or infrastructure component touched during implementation must be
checked against its authoritative upstream release and pinned to the latest stable
compatible version. An immutable fork revision remains valid only when the required
behavior has no stable upstream release and the reason is recorded beside the pin.

## Intended Outcome

Veoveo will make long-running work recoverable without asking a model to reconstruct
platform state. An accepted task, operator input, or resource update survives token
rotation, process exit, and lease transfer. Correctable input errors remain inside the
current episode and carry bounded guidance.

Disposable development deployment will gain a pure rendered closure for non-optional
Secret references before its existing mutation path can run. It will not create or
rewrite installation Secret material. Selected-release development iteration remains
evidence-gated and cannot become an enterprise installation API or a smoke-harness
orchestration responsibility.

Map will use one explicit longitude/latitude interpretation. Standalone MCP Apps will
reuse the Console security boundary and upstream stream fanout. Frames and Time will
return references that downstream compilers can admit without searching a catalog.
Approved optional model controls will use provider-admitted typed contracts. Qualified
GPU capacity work and private build inputs will proceed only after their evidence or
downstream-need gates pass.

## Delivery Ledger

| ID | Priority | Delivery decision | Primary phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AGENT-CONTINUATION-001` | P0 | retain the delivered durable runtime. Audit lineage and add crash-window evidence before adding new persistence | 1 |
| `TOOL-DIAGNOSTICS-002` | P0 | implement against final MCP errors and current Rig, not the obsolete reference module | 1 |
| `DEPLOY-SCOPE-003` | evidence-gated | first prove a concrete disposable-development iteration need. Do not make it an enterprise API or reserve a schema revision | 2B |
| `SECRET-CLOSURE-004` | P0 | add pure rendered validation of owner-supplied Secret references before the existing development mutation path | 2A |
| `APP-HOST-005` | ergonomic | add the standalone route through the existing Console BFF, frame, bridge, and session | 4 |
| `STREAM-FANOUT-006` | retain and verify | retain the delivered auth-scoped per-URI listener pool. Add capacity and multi-tab evidence | 4 |
| `CREDENTIAL-REFRESH-007` | P0, elevated from P1 | repair the missing agent resource listener and make replacement readiness atomic | 1 |
| `RESOURCE-DISCOVERY-008` | ergonomic | retain domain-owned canonical URIs. Add canonical task handoff, bounded domain discovery, pagination, and agent read budgets without a universal token | 5 |
| `REASONING-CONTROLS-009` | optional | add only for an approved provider configuration need, with capability validation | 6 |
| `ACCELERATOR-ADMISSION-010` | evidence-gated | require measured same-device contention and qualified workload data before changing the deployment profile | 7 |
| `SOURCE-PROVENANCE-011` | ergonomic | add used-source Frames references and effective Time authority references | 8 |
| `SPATIAL-TYPING-012` | P1, elevated from P2 | correct Map axis and distance semantics before further spatial query expansion | 3 |
| `PRIVATE-BUILD-INPUTS-013` | optional | add one opt-in BuildKit-secret contract for repository-managed builders without constraining external build systems | 9 |

`STREAM-FANOUT-006` does not authorize a second browser or gateway fanout system. The
current Console BFF already reference-counts one upstream listener per auth scope and
resource URI. Implementation changes only its bounds, refresh evidence, and standalone
host coverage unless tests prove a different deficiency.

### Delivery posture

| Track | Included work | Completion meaning |
|---|---|---|
| core correctness | agent listener refresh, safe tool diagnostics, continuation crash evidence, rendered Secret-reference closure, and Map spatial correction | required before this plan's correctness release closes |
| downstream ergonomics | standalone Apps, bounded resource handoff and discovery, and Frames/Time provenance | each milestone may ship independently after its own acceptance |
| optional tooling | provider reasoning controls and private BuildKit inputs | starts only for an approved downstream need and never blocks core closure |
| evidence-gated capacity | selected-release development iteration and GPU memory admission | starts only after the phase records the required evidence and an owner approves the contract change |

No client request is accepted as one indivisible implementation. The plan adopts the
useful outcome and rejects a mechanism when it would create parallel identity,
installation authority, or build ownership.

### Implementation record

| Phase | State on 2026-08-17 | Delivered evidence | Remaining closure |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | complete | decisions, protocol versions, ownership, hard-cut surfaces, and the test-driven sequence are recorded in `f2130bef` and `49b9d7ad` | none |
| 1 | complete | Rig fork commit `1c59bf04` and Veoveo commits `da284e64` and `ceb1be9d` deliver typed subscriptions, resource reads, request-boundary preflight, make-before-break rotation, graceful cancellation, exact declared-resource wakes, safe diagnostics, cumulative budgets, and a passing hardware-GPU agent pilot | none |
| 2A | complete | `25404ab0` inserts a pure rendered Secret-reference closure before the development mutation boundary. Contract and smoke suites pass. A revision-pinned disposable K3s audit records only Secret and Namespace GETs and zero writes when three owner-supplied Secrets are absent | none |
| 2B | unopened | the required ownership evidence was not supplied | retain the existing deployment ownership model |
| 3 | complete | `b6ca32ce` hard-cuts Map axis, typed distance scoring, and cursor behavior. DuckDB and Map suites pass, including restart coverage | none |
| 4 | complete | `9cd3ceab` adds the standalone App route through the shared Console host. `99ae7da7` requires both host preflights, and `47f0ef7e` gives that contract its own focused command. Console BFF, web, browser-smoke, and authenticated headed-browser gates pass on the deployed revision with hardware graphics | none |
| 5 | complete | `70617b25`, `7634d03c`, `5e202843`, and `280d634b` close atomic task consumption, serialized response caps, bounded canonical discovery, and retention metadata handoff. Phase 1 adds the kernel read ledger and remote-pin pilot evidence | none |
| 6 | unopened optional track | no provider configuration need was approved | no action |
| 7 | unopened evidence-gated track | no qualified same-device contention evidence was accepted | no action |
| 8 | complete | `674fbb27`, `14c4bb57`, and `3c9e56e6` expose exact Frames and Time provenance and keep the contract fixture authoritative | none |
| 9 | unopened optional track | no repository-managed private build need was approved | no action |
| 10 | complete for approved scope | applicable focused suites, broad durable-task suites, Console gates, the remote-pinned Phase 1 suites, the hardware agent pilot, the disposable-cluster zero-write audit, exact GitOps convergence, and the focused hardware browser host gate pass. The locked repository-wide formatting, all-target check, strict clippy, and library/binary test gates pass | optional and evidence-gated tracks remain unopened by design |

The Phase 2A environmental check used a temporary Git-owned profile and lock pinned to
Veoveo `35ba4a1b` and the exact platform-chart archive. Its disposable K3s v1.35.5
cluster enabled Kubernetes metadata auditing before `profile-up`. The rendered closure
found 11 required keys across `veoveo-installation-secrets`, `veoveo-surreal-admin`, and
`veoveo-surreal-runtime`, then returned `missing_secret`. The command's audit window
contained only GET requests and `writeCount: 0`; the target Namespace remained absent.
A later server-side dry-run canary appeared as a `create` request in the same audit log
and remained unpersisted, which proves the policy could detect the prohibited verb. The
disposable cluster was deleted after the check.

The Bioma installation now resolves the release-input commit
`fb96bb790c665468e2f1eeac3566cb8b7baa012b` through parent activation
`b65e70de30be73be22cd46a8cce416d83dfcb373`. The typed convergence harness recorded
successful fetch, render, apply, rollout, and readiness for the platform deployment set
in `output/development/gitops-convergence-gateway-repair-b65e70de.json`. The earlier
application rollout is recorded in
`output/development/gitops-convergence-platform-improvements-185b4bcb.json`.

The rollout exposed a gateway replica taking about 39 seconds to finish its SurrealDB
startup work while liveness committed to termination after roughly 30 seconds. The
rendered-chart regression failed before the gateway had a startup probe. Commit
`25866592` adds a 120-second startup window without weakening steady-state liveness,
updates the exact Bioma control-plane digest, and repairs stale Helm smoke expectations.
Both replicas reached readiness with zero restarts after the repair.

`cargo xtask smoke uav-app-hosts-browser-verify --public-base-url
https://veoveo.bioma.ai --chrome-cdp-url http://127.0.0.1:9222` passes against headed
Chrome 151 on the RTX 4090. It authenticates both the Console and standalone routes,
loads the shared App frame, and rejects software-only browser graphics. The broader UAV
two-viewer throughput verifier remains strict and currently reports a baseline simulator
regression of 9.9–11.2 delivered FPS and 93–99 ms source-to-render p95 against its 12 FPS
and 85 ms gates. That failure occurs after both App-host preflights and does not weaken
or reopen the standalone-host milestone.

### Recorded red-green evidence

| Concern | Red observation | Permanent green proof |
|---|---|---|
| Rig request handoff | `task_descriptor_uses_the_preflight_selected_client` showed a task descriptor retaining the cancelled preflight client | the focused test passes at fork commit `1c59bf04`. `cargo test -p rig-agent --features rmcp` passes 535 unit tests and 20 integration tests, and the matching clippy gate is clean |
| durable retention handoff | the real `agent-pilot` reached terminal Optimization completion, then failed because the hosted task adapter had lost the repository retention pin lifted into RMCP request context | two task-runtime metadata tests pass, all eleven affected crate suites pass, and the same pilot completes on an RTX 4090 with the immutable cuOpt executor image |
| Secret closure | the missing-reference fixture reached the development mutation boundary before a complete rendered closure existed | deployment contract and smoke tests reject the fixture before the mutating boundary; a revision-pinned disposable K3s run records zero API writes and leaves its target Namespace absent |
| Map distance contract | old-axis and old-cursor fixtures exposed ambiguous coordinate interpretation and reusable legacy cursor state | DuckDB runtime and Map suites prove `geometry_always_xy`, one typed materialized distance score, stable ordering after reopen, and rejection of the old cursor domain |
| standalone App route | the authorized standalone route and bootstrap behavior were absent; the focused real-browser verifier initially opened only the Console host | Console BFF route and host tests pass, the web application passes test, lint, typecheck, and production build gates, and the deployed focused host command passes both Console and standalone preflights in headed hardware Chrome |
| gateway rollout startup | one new replica needed about 39 seconds for store startup, while liveness committed to killing it after roughly 30 seconds | the rendered chart requires a 120-second startup probe, the Helm smoke passes, exact GitOps convergence succeeds, and both deployed replicas remain ready with zero restarts |
| serialized task resources | oversized serialized results and growing result discovery exceeded the intended bounded handoff | MCP conformance, task-runtime, and affected domain suites prove the response cap, exact lookup, stable pagination, and atomic consumption |
| exact provenance | conversion results could require catalog search to discover the effective Frames revision or Time authority | Frames, Time, and MCP contract tests accept exact typed references directly |
| copied deployment catalog | the repository-wide test found stale Timeseries and Optimization contract revisions in the Bioma composition | `696935da` aligns the copied typed metadata, the focused Bioma acceptance passes, and the complete locked workspace library/binary gate passes |

The red transcripts remain review evidence rather than expected-failure tests. The green
tests are committed with their owning changes. Phase 1 is delivered from the immutable
Rig fork revision, and the Veoveo remote pin reproduces its focused, runtime, clippy, and
hardware-pilot results.

## Repository Invariants

- The change is a hard cut at every revised schema, resource grammar, cursor domain,
  command, and configuration field. No alias or compatibility reader is added.
- Provider work remains webhook-completed. No phase adds status polling, recovery
  polling, or a polling fallback.
- GPU workloads continue to fail closed without the selected NVIDIA device, driver,
  and accelerated backend. Memory admission cannot select a CPU or alternate model.
- Browser acceptance uses a headed browser with a hardware-backed WebGPU adapter or
  WebGL context. SwiftShader, llvmpipe, and software rasterizers are rejected.
- Known contract shapes use Rust types and closed enums. Raw JSON remains confined to
  provider-owned payloads, Kubernetes object parsing before typed projection, and other
  genuinely open boundaries.
- Authentication, authorization, transport, timeout, and internal diagnostics remain
  generic at the model boundary. No phase exposes database errors, credentials,
  provider bodies, hidden reasoning, or policy internals.
- Typed deployment profiles remain disposable-development inputs. They are not an
  enterprise installation API, and smoke verification does not own installation
  orchestration.
- Canonical identity remains each domain's governed resource URI and MCP resource link.
  No universal hash-derived resource token or parallel public identity is added.
- Real Secret values never enter a deployment plan, error, log, receipt, build
  argument, cache key, SBOM, provenance statement, or committed test fixture. Ephemeral
  synthetic canaries may prove redaction and are destroyed with the test environment.
- Installation Secret bytes remain owner-supplied. Repository tooling may validate
  references and key presence but does not create, replace, or transfer ownership of
  those Secrets.
- Smoke assertions, evidence, and scenario-local lifecycle remain in Rust. Installation
  orchestration remains with Helm and the installation reconciliation controller. The
  `xtask` smoke command only builds and dispatches the typed verification harness.
- Optional and evidence-gated tracks do not block the core correctness release.

## Reference Patch Policy

| Patch | Use during implementation | Rejected behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `0001-typed-spatial-distance.patch` | port the axis setting, typed overload, materialized score, and cursor-domain hard cut | mechanical application against the older analytics layout |
| `0002-explicit-reasoning-controls.patch` | use its request-rendering test as a narrow example | a `none`-only enum, model-specific comments, and missing provider capability validation |
| `0003-actionable-resource-read-errors.patch` | retain the bounded-normalization and safe/generic classification intent | the deleted `resource_read.rs` baseline, the superseded resource error constant, and old Rig APIs |
| `0004-compiler-ready-frame-provenance.patch` | use as a starting diff after the source-use audit | returning every preloaded revision or retaining an unvalidated digest string |
| `0005-shared-app-frame-sandbox.patch` | extract one shared sandbox constant with a behavioral test | treating a source-text search as the only security proof |
| `0006-standalone-mcp-app-host.patch` | port the same-host route, BFF endpoints, and shared frame composition | duplicated URI grammar, raw principal-subject display, and brittle source-layout assertions |

## Phase And Dependency Order

| Phase | Depends on | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Baseline and contract locks | none | accepted decisions, protocol versions, owners, and hard-cut surfaces are recorded |
| 1. Agent connection and correction | 0 | resource wakes survive refresh. Safe invalid input is corrected in one episode. The crash matrix passes |
| 2A. Development Secret closure | 0 | owner-supplied Secret references close before the existing disposable-profile mutation path, with zero writes on failure |
| 2B. Selected development scope | evidence gate in 2A | an approved local iteration design preserves unselected sources without becoming installation orchestration |
| 3. Map spatial correction | 0 | axis, typed distance, cursor invalidation, and restart evidence pass |
| 4. Standalone Apps | 1 for stable resource listeners | any authorized App opens through the shared host. Multi-tab use stays within explicit capacity |
| 5. Resource handoff and discovery | 1 | domain URIs remain canonical while handoff, lookup, pagination, and byte/read budgets pass in the selected domains |
| 6. Optional model reasoning | approved provider need | provider capability and exact request-rendering tests pass without fallback |
| 7. Evidence-gated GPU memory admission | measured same-device need and 2A | qualified co-located groups fit declared capacity with headroom on real hardware |
| 8. Frames and Time provenance | 0 | downstream admission accepts exact domain-owned source references without catalog search |
| 9. Optional private build inputs | approved repository-managed build need | clean-cache builds pass in every opted-in builder family and evidence contains no canary bytes |
| 10. Core closure and independent milestone closure | applicable completed phases | core gates close together. Every other track closes independently with its own evidence |

Phases 1, 2A, and 3 may proceed in parallel after phase 0 because their code ownership
is disjoint. Phases 4, 5, and 8 are independent ergonomic milestones after their stated
prerequisites. Phases 2B and 7 pause at their evidence gates. Phases 6 and 9 do not start
without an approved downstream need. The commit order within each active phase is fixed
below. A later concern must not be folded into an earlier contract commit merely to
reduce the number of schema revisions.

## Test-Driven Delivery Method

Every active implementation concern begins with an executable statement of the missing
behavior. A regression test targets the smallest owning layer that can prove the defect.
A contract addition begins with an acceptance test written against the proposed public
shape. Integration and hardware claims begin with a qualified scenario that cannot pass
through a mock or fallback.

Use this red-green-refactor sequence:

1. Write one focused test with the final behavior in its name and assertions.
2. Run it against the recorded baseline. Confirm that it fails because the behavior is
   missing, not because the fixture, dependency, credentials, or environment is broken.
3. Record the exact command, baseline revision, failing assertion, and bounded output in
   the change or review evidence. Do not commit a deliberately failing shared branch.
4. Implement the smallest change in the component that owns the contract. Do not make a
   neighboring layer compensate for the failure.
5. Run the focused test until it passes, then run the owning crate or application suite.
6. Refactor only while the focused and owning suites remain green.
7. Run the applicable integration, cluster, GPU, or headed-browser acceptance. A unit
   mock cannot close a claim about live transport, Kubernetes mutation, hardware, or
   browser rendering.
8. Commit the test and fix together as one coherent green concern. A test-only commit is
   acceptable only when it passes and captures existing correct behavior without hiding
   an expected failure.

If the first correctly scoped test passes on the baseline, investigate before changing
code. Existing behavior may already satisfy the client outcome. In that case retain the
implementation, strengthen only missing evidence, and record the request as verified
rather than forcing a redundant rewrite.

### Red-green planning matrix

| Request | First red or characterization test | Green proof |
|---|---|---|
| agent continuation | crash after task settlement, wake claim, and input answer at each documented transaction boundary | restart produces one terminal wake, one consume transaction, and one receipt. If baseline passes, no persistence change lands |
| tool diagnostics | read an unknown governed URI and a protected failing URI through the current agent adapter | safe invalid input reaches the same episode with bounded guidance, while protected failures remain generic |
| selected development scope | no red test before the 2B evidence gate | after approval, two independent releases prove that the development driver issues no request for the unselected owner |
| Secret closure | use an audited fake and disposable cluster with a missing referenced Secret before the current development path starts | the same scenario fails before any mutating Kubernetes or Helm verb |
| standalone App | request a valid authorized `/apps/...` route and exercise bootstrap through the existing BFF | the shared frame opens with Console-equivalent auth, CSP, sandbox, bridge, and return behavior |
| stream fanout | open two tabs for one auth scope and URI, then close them independently | one upstream listener serves both and is cancelled after the final subscriber. If baseline passes, only bounds evidence changes |
| credential refresh | rotate a short-lived token while a declared resource subscription is active | replacement subscription acknowledgement precedes epoch publication and wakes continue without polling |
| resource handoff | run a terminal task and bounded domain listing that currently presents competing identifiers or an unbounded collection | one canonical domain result URI is presented, exact lookup remains possible, and pagination and read budgets close |
| reasoning controls | only after approval, render omitted, disabled, each named effort, and one unsupported provider/model pair | exact admitted wire fields render, unsupported configuration fails before connection, and no fallback occurs |
| GPU memory admission | only after the evidence gate, run qualified co-located workloads whose measured peak exceeds admitted headroom | profile validation rejects unsafe placement and qualified real hardware passes the locked capacity plan |
| Frames and Time provenance | compile output from a conversion that uses known revisions and one prefetched unused revision | only effective typed source references reach the downstream compiler without catalog search |
| spatial typing | run a representative longitude/latitude distance, effective-setting check, and old-cursor fixture | the typed spherical distance and axis are correct, the score is reused once, and the old cursor fails |
| private build inputs | only after approval, resolve an immutable private dependency from an empty cache with a canary credential | opted-in repository builders fetch through secret mounts, compile offline, and leak no canary bytes into evidence |

The red transcript is review evidence, not a permanent expected-failure test. The green
test remains in the repository as the regression or conformance gate.

## Phase 0: Baseline And Contract Locks

### Delivered state to preserve

The agent runtime already persists wakes, episodes, task watches, input requests,
retention pins, and outbox events. Main also detaches accepted MCP Tasks from bounded
model episodes through `agents/kernel/src/background_tasks.rs`. Task settlement creates
the terminal wake transactionally, and episode completion consumes claimed wakes while
releasing task retention pins.

The Console BFF already owns an auth-scoped MCP client pool. Its App subscription table
maps browser subscription UUIDs to resource URIs, opens one upstream listener for the
first subscriber, and cancels that listener after the final subscriber leaves.

Deployment v6 owns exact source revisions and release lists, but its `ResourceSet` is
profile-global. The disposable development path validates the full profile and then
performs its existing repository-local setup. It checks some installation-owned Secret
requirements only after earlier mutations. This plan may close that validation gap but
does not broaden the path into an enterprise installer.

Map loads the trusted Spatial extension but leaves `geometry_always_xy` at the engine
default. Its distance queries use generic point construction, and source-feature
queries repeat their score expression in filtering, cursor comparison, projection, and
ordering. Cursor query digests do not name the distance algorithm revision.

### Contract preparation

1. Update `mcp/contract/DESIGN.md` in the first protocol-changing commit. Record the
   safe diagnostic data subset, canonical URI handoff, wire caps, and final MCP error
   mapping. Domain-owned resource identities remain in their server designs.
2. Update `deploy/contract/DESIGN.md` with the pure rendered Secret-reference closure
   before changing the disposable development path. Do not allocate a new deployment
   schema version unless an approved typed field actually changes.
3. Update the owning server `DESIGN.md` beside Frames, Time, and Map when each output or
   algorithm changes. Each design keeps its `Standards And Protocols` section current.
4. Update `mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md` when the standalone host becomes an advertised
   browser surface. The reactive resource adapter remains a Veoveo extension rather
   than an ext-apps claim.
5. Record any necessary Rig API addition before changing the exact Git pin. Verify
   whether a stable upstream release contains the required listener and request hook.
   Keep the fork only when no stable release supplies the behavior.

### Exit evidence

- The accepted and rejected patch behavior is represented in design text.
- Every new public or installation schema has one owner and one version transition.
- No implementation phase relies on an unstated legacy alias.
- The core, ergonomic, optional, and evidence-gated tracks have separate approval and
  completion boundaries.

## Phase 1: Agent Connection, Correction, And Continuation

### 1.1 Restore declared resource listeners

Current `GatewayConnection::rotate` creates a replacement Rig guard, records the
manifest subscription count, publishes the new epoch, and closes the old guard. It does
not open a `subscriptions/listen` request or connect resource notifications to
`WakeBus`. The manifest promise is therefore unfulfilled on initial connection and on
refresh.

Implementation ownership:

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| final MCP listener handle and accepted-filter result | Rig MCP adapter or a minimal typed Rig API addition |
| token mint, stale threshold, epoch publication, listener swap | `agents/kernel/src/connection.rs` |
| resource-update notification to durable wake | kernel connection listener and `agents/kernel/src/wake.rs` |
| declared filter validation | `agents/kernel/src/manifest.rs` |
| task watcher reconstruction on an epoch change | `agents/kernel/src/tasks.rs` |

The replacement connection becomes live only after all of these steps succeed:

1. Mint one fresh access token through the configured client-credentials flow.
2. Connect the replacement MCP client and verify Discover through the existing Rig
   lifecycle.
3. Build one deterministic `SubscriptionFilter` from the complete sorted manifest URI
   set. Duplicate URIs have already failed manifest validation.
4. Open `subscriptions/listen` and require the server's successful listener response
   before treating the filter as active.
5. Start the notification pump. Only `ResourceUpdatedNotification` values whose URI is
   in the accepted filter become durable resource wakes. List-change notifications
   invalidate discovery state but do not fabricate a domain resource wake.
6. Publish the resolver and listener as one `ConnectionEpoch`.
7. Cancel the previous listener with bounded acknowledgement, then cancel its guard.

The live state owns the guard, listener cancellation handle, listener task, token
timestamps, and epoch. A failed token mint, connect, listener acknowledgement, or pump
startup leaves the previous live state untouched. Cleanup failure after a successful
swap is observable but does not roll back the new epoch.

Credential freshness moves from episode-start-only behavior to the MCP request
boundary. The adapter checks the stale fraction before dispatch. Concurrent requests
share one serialized refresh. An authorization response permits at most one forced
refresh when the transport can prove that the request did not reach domain execution.
A mutating tool call is never replayed after an indeterminate dispatch.

### 1.2 Add the current-profile resource access boundary

The kernel needs one governed resource adapter that can call `resources/read` through
the active MCP client without exposing an unrestricted protocol peer to model code.
Place connection-independent policy, read accounting, content validation, and model
error mapping in a focused kernel resource module. Keep token rotation and listener
lifecycle in `connection.rs`.

Introduce closed types with these responsibilities:

| Type | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ResourceReadLimits` | maximum contents, item bytes, response bytes, cumulative episode bytes, reads per episode, reads per family, wall time, and pagination depth |
| `ResourceReadLedger` | episode-local atomic accounting and the remaining safe budget reported after rejection |
| `SafeCorrectionDiagnostic` | bounded code, kind, requested URI, normalized guidance, and `automatic_retry = false` |
| `ResourceReadFailure` | controlled invalid resource, prohibited content, budget exhausted, unavailable connection, authorization, timeout, transport, or internal failure |

The adapter admits only absolute governed resource URIs. It rejects credential-bearing
URIs, fragments, browser-only `ui://` content, local file and network schemes, HTML,
event streams, and content that exceeds a configured bound. Binary resource bytes are
not inserted into the model context unless a domain contract explicitly admits their
bounded MIME type.

Unknown resource URIs remain JSON-RPC `Invalid Params` (`-32602`) on the MCP wire. The
kernel may project a safe, bounded invalid-resource message to the model when the
upstream error contains only admitted diagnostic data. It discards upstream error data
by default. Authorization, internal, timeout, and transport failures use fixed generic
messages.

Domain tool validation follows the existing final-profile rule. A schema-valid call
with bad domain input returns a completed `CallToolResult` with `isError: true` and
actionable structured content. A protocol failure remains a protocol failure. The same
classification must survive official Tasks.

### 1.3 Keep correction inside the episode

Rig receives `SafeCorrectionDiagnostic` as a non-retryable tool input result. The model
may issue a corrected call in the same episode while its turn, tool, byte, and wall-time
budgets remain. The kernel does not launch an outer episode retry for a controlled
input error.

Lifecycle compare-and-set errors expose only the current allowed state, record
revision, accepted field names, and a stable error code. Storage text and query details
remain internal. The shared server handler path should own this conversion rather than
duplicating it across domain servers.

### 1.4 Audit continuation lineage before extending the schema

The audit traces operator message, episode, detached Task, multi-round input request,
terminal task wake, consuming episode, retention release, and outbox receipt. Existing
records remain authoritative. Add a new operator-root or continuation receipt type only
when this trace cannot identify one root and one terminal consume transaction without
parsing free text.

If a gap exists, add strong identities to the agent runtime and platform-store
migration. The root is persisted before episode dispatch. Child tasks and input
requests carry it. Terminal consumption writes one durable receipt in the same
transaction that acknowledges the wake and releases retention. A unique database key
rejects duplicate receipt creation.

The audit does not replace canonical MCP Task IDs, wake IDs, episode IDs, or input
request IDs with a universal string. Those identities retain their current contracts
and reference the root through typed fields.

### Agent acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| initial connection | the exact manifest filter is acknowledged and every selected resource update creates one durable wake |
| successful rotation | the replacement listener is live before epoch publication and the previous listener receives bounded cancellation |
| failed rotation | the prior epoch continues serving requests and resource wakes. No partial epoch is visible |
| token expires during an episode | the request boundary performs one serialized refresh and every declared resource remains subscribed |
| concurrent refresh | many callers cause one token mint and one listener replacement |
| invalid resource | the requested URI and normalized safe guidance reach the model within the byte cap |
| protected failure | authorization, transport, timeout, and internal strings do not reach model-visible output |
| same-episode correction | one intentionally wrong URI is followed by a successful corrected read without another episode |
| task completion crash | termination after task settlement but before wake consumption yields one terminal wake and one consumption receipt after restart |
| wake claim crash | an expired lease reclaims the wake without double consumption |
| input answer crash | answer and wake remain atomic across restart |
| budget exhaustion | the machine-readable result reports exhausted dimension and remaining permitted actions without performing a read |

Focused source gates:

```sh
cargo test -p veoveo-agent-kernel
cargo test -p veoveo-agent-runtime
cargo test -p veoveo-mcp-contract
cargo test -p veoveo-task-runtime
```

Integration evidence uses the Rust agent smoke harness and a real SurrealDB instance.
The token-expiry scenario needs a short-lived test issuer and the final Gateway MCP
path. It must not replace resource-notification evidence with polling.

## Phase 2: Development Profile Secret Closure And Conditional Selection

### 2A.1 Preserve the installation boundary

Typed deployment profiles remain confined to disposable repository-development
environments. Production and enterprise installations continue to reconcile separate
platform and extension Helm applications from installation-owned desired state. This
phase does not create an enterprise deployment API, install a reconciliation
controller, or grant the smoke harness installation authority.

The installation owner supplies every Secret through its secret-management and
Kubernetes reconciliation path. Veoveo repository tooling does not create, patch,
replace, copy, or transfer ownership of a Secret. The required P0 change is a pure
closure check before the existing disposable-development mutation path performs its
first write.

### 2A.2 Build the rendered Secret-reference closure

Add focused internal types to `deploy/contract` without changing the public deployment
schema unless a new serialized field is required:

| Type | Contract |
|---|---|
| `KubernetesObjectKey` | group, version, kind, namespace or cluster scope, and name |
| `SecretReferenceRequirement` | referring object, exact field path, Secret name, optional key, optionality, and reference kind |
| `SecretClosure` | profile and lock digests, complete sorted requirements, presence results, and terminal validation status without Secret values |

Resolve the complete v6 profile and exact lock through the existing pure contract path.
Render every admitted chart and raw object that the disposable profile already intends
to use. Parsing walks these non-optional references:

- container and init-container `env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef`.
- container and init-container `envFrom[].secretRef`.
- Secret volumes and projected Secret sources.
- pod `imagePullSecrets`.
- Ingress and Gateway TLS certificate references.
- chart-owned custom-resource fields explicitly registered by the deployment contract.

An admitted custom resource with an unregistered Secret-bearing shape makes the closure
unverifiable and fails before mutation. The closure cannot silently claim completeness
for an unknown shape.

The trusted disposable-development driver may read an existing Secret only when it
already has that authority and key-presence validation requires it. It discards values
immediately after the check. The closure, diagnostics, logs, errors, and evidence retain
only names, required keys, presence flags, and bounded failure codes. Authoritative
NotFound means a missing dependency. Forbidden, timeout, malformed, and transport
failures remain distinct and fail closed.

### 2A.3 Insert one zero-write gate

The existing disposable-development path must compute and validate the complete closure
before Namespace creation, allocator changes, raw manifest application, ConfigMap
creation, gateway activation, Helm invocation, or hooks. A failed closure returns
without issuing a mutating Kubernetes or Helm request.

This phase adds no selected executor and no new lifecycle command. Rust smoke code owns
the assertions and API-audit evidence. Helm and the installation reconciliation
controller retain installation orchestration.

### 2B.1 Require evidence before selected-release design

`DEPLOY-SCOPE-003` pauses until a downstream development workflow records all of the
following:

- measured full-profile iteration time and the target bound.
- the exact independently owned release that needs isolated iteration.
- proof that ordinary Helm or GitOps selection cannot meet the disposable-development
  need without unsafe ownership overlap.
- a named owner for the development driver outside smoke verification.
- an architecture review confirming that the command cannot be mistaken for an
  enterprise installation API.

No command name or deployment schema revision is reserved before this gate passes. If
approved, the design may introduce typed release ownership in the next available
profile version. It must read the complete lock, reject selected/unselected ownership
collisions, and preserve all unselected owned fields. The smoke harness verifies those
claims but does not perform the installation.

Read-only managed-field inspection may then explain a selected/unselected collision.
It does not invoke server-side apply, transfer ownership, replay stored Helm manifests,
or claim that repository tooling owns controller-managed objects.

### Phase 2 acceptance matrix

| Track | Test | Required proof |
|---|---|---|
| required 2A | missing Secret | complete rendering fails before the API audit log records any mutating verb |
| required 2A | missing Secret key | key absence is reported without retaining or printing another key or value |
| required 2A | forbidden Secret read | failure is not classified as NotFound and no write occurs |
| required 2A | unknown custom-resource shape | closure is reported as unverifiable before mutation |
| required 2A | successful closure | the existing development path receives one immutable closure tied to exact profile and lock digests |
| conditional 2B | evidence gate | measured need, target bound, driver owner, and architecture approval are recorded |
| conditional 2B | unselected source | no installation request targets an unselected ownership key and its owned fields remain unchanged |
| conditional 2B | managed-field observation | selected ownership conflicts are diagnostic only and no ownership-changing request occurs |
| conditional 2B | enterprise boundary | enterprise examples and reconciliation contracts acquire no development command or profile dependency |

Focused required gates:

```sh
cargo test -p veoveo-deploy-contract
cargo test -p veoveo-deployment-smoke
```

Required cluster acceptance uses a disposable Kubernetes/K3s installation. The
missing-Secret scenario captures the API audit log before validation and proves that no
mutating verb was issued. Conditional 2B tests do not enter the required gate until its
evidence and architecture review are accepted.

## Phase 3: Map Spatial Axis And Distance Hard Cut

### 3.1 Type the engine axis policy

Replace a raw boolean proposal with a closed DuckDB runtime setting such as
`SpatialAxisPolicy::{Native, GeoJsonLongitudeLatitude}`. The default remains `Native`.
The non-native variant requires the trusted Spatial extension and configures
`geometry_always_xy` after loading that extension but before external access and
configuration are locked.

Map selects `GeoJsonLongitudeLatitude`. The general DuckDB MCP server explicitly
selects `Native`, because arbitrary SQL owns its own declared geometry interpretation.
The runtime readiness query reads `current_setting('geometry_always_xy')` and fails when
the effective setting does not match the selected enum.

### 3.2 Use one typed score

Map distance calls use `ST_Point2D` for longitude/latitude inputs. A geometry centroid
is explicitly cast to `POINT_2D` before `ST_Distance_Sphere`. Each distance query creates
one `WITH ... AS MATERIALIZED` score relation and reuses `distance_m` for maximum
distance, cursor comparison, projection, and ordering.

Cursor validation requires a distance for distance-ordered results and rejects one for
feature-ordered results. Non-finite and negative distance values fail before query
execution.

### 3.3 Invalidate pre-fix cursors

Domain-separate the request digest with a new constant such as
`veoveo.io/map/source-feature-query/v2\0`. The cursor decoder accepts only the new
domain. No v1 cursor reader or fallback is retained. Update the Map design and tool
description to state the axis and cursor hard cut.

### Spatial acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| runtime validation | non-native axis policy without the Spatial extension fails |
| effective setting | Map reads `geometry_always_xy = true`. DuckDB MCP retains its native setting |
| typed overload | one longitudinal degree at a representative latitude returns the admitted meter range |
| materialization | query-plan or instrumentation evidence shows one distance score per candidate row |
| cursor shape | distance and non-distance cursor fields are mutually consistent |
| hard cut | a cursor generated with the previous digest domain is rejected |
| restart | the same representative query and ordering survive database close and reopen |

Focused gates:

```sh
cargo test -p veoveo-duckdb-runtime
cargo test -p veoveo-map-mcp
```

The extension-backed tests require the repository-selected DuckDB Spatial extension.
A test skipped because the extension is absent is not acceptance evidence for this
phase.

## Phase 4: Standalone MCP App Host

### 4.1 Define one route authority

The BFF owns a strong `StandaloneAppRoute` parsed from `/apps/{server}/{page...}`. The
server segment uses `ServerSlug`. The page path is a bounded sequence of decoded path
segments ending in the exact application document name. Empty segments, dot segments,
encoded separators, backslashes, credentials, queries used as identity, control
characters, invalid UTF-8, and overlong paths fail before catalog access.

The BFF maps the validated route to one `ui://{server}/{page...}` resource and checks it
against the caller's authorized App catalog. Browser TypeScript never reconstructs this
URI. It receives the authorized `AppDescriptor` from a same-origin BFF bootstrap call.

### 4.2 Reuse the Console boundary

The standalone page imports the delivered `AppFrame`, bridge, theme projection, frame
endpoint, resource-read adapter, resource event stream, internal-link rules, and CSRF
client. Extract one exported sandbox constant and keep `allow-scripts` without
`allow-same-origin`. Console and standalone hosts pass that same constant to the same
component.

The entry document may remain public and `no-store`. Its first authenticated bootstrap
request uses the existing OAuth transition. Rename `ConsoleReturnPath` to the accurate
hard-cut name `BrowserReturnPath` and admit exactly `/console/` and `/apps/`. The parser
retains same-origin enforcement and the existing length bound. No second OAuth flow,
session cookie, bearer bridge, or callback endpoint is created.

The minimal host header displays the App's authorized title and a return link. It does
not display the raw principal subject. Any later display identity uses the bounded
principal display metadata already separated from authorization identity.

### 4.3 Keep one upstream stream per URI

The existing auth-scoped listener pool remains canonical. Add an explicit maximum for
active upstream App resource listeners and active downstream browser subscriptions per
auth scope. Capacity exhaustion returns a bounded machine-readable response. It never
silently drops a listener or opens a second gateway connection.

EventSource reconnect with the same UUID remains idempotent. A refreshed Console token
creates a new auth-scoped MCP client. The browser reconnect re-establishes the selected
resource against that client, and the old listener receives bounded cancellation.
Closing the final tab releases the upstream listener deterministically.

### App acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| route grammar | valid nested page paths map exactly. Traversal, encoded separator, authority, and length attacks fail |
| catalog authority | a syntactically valid but unauthorized App route returns no App metadata or frame bytes |
| shared frame | both hosts render the same component, sandbox constant, referrer policy, and bridge |
| CSP parity | the frame response for one App has byte-identical CSP under Console and standalone navigation |
| cold login | authentication returns to the complete original `/apps/...` path |
| bridge parity | tools, resources, links, theme, sizing, and lifecycle notifications match Console behavior |
| multi-tab fanout | two tabs for one resource create one upstream listener and independent downstream deliveries |
| capacity | exceeding the configured bound returns an explicit error and leaves existing streams healthy |
| cleanup | final tab close and token replacement both cancel obsolete listeners within the bound |

Focused gates:

```sh
cargo test -p veoveo-console-bff
cd apps/console/web && npm test
cd apps/console/web && npm run lint
cd apps/console/web && npm run build
```

Browser acceptance belongs in the Rust browser-smoke harness. It launches a headed
browser only after proving a hardware-backed WebGPU adapter or WebGL context. Loss of
the last hardware graphics API stops the run. API-only checks and screenshots cannot
substitute for the visual workflow.

## Phase 5: Canonical Resource Handoff And Bounded Discovery

### 5.1 Preserve domain-owned identity

The canonical public identity remains the resource URI owned by each domain and the MCP
resource link that carries it across servers. Artifact occurrences retain fresh opaque
UUIDv7 identities. Content digests remain integrity and provenance fields rather than
public addresses.

Do not add a universal `ResourceToken`, a hash-derived parallel identifier, or a shared
index item that erases domain vocabulary. Do not migrate a working domain URI merely to
make identifiers look uniform. `mcp/contract` may own generic bounds and handoff rules,
but every server continues to own its resource grammar, search filters, result
discriminators, and authorization semantics.

Before changing a domain, add characterization tests for its terminal results, exact
lookup, growing collections, pagination, and serialized sizes. A domain that already
presents one canonical URI and bounded discovery receives evidence only. It does not
receive a new schema for consistency with another server.

### 5.2 Canonical task handoff

When a successful task produces an addressable domain product, its structured terminal
result presents exactly one follow-on `result_uri` using that domain's canonical URI.
Adjacent text contains a short status without another opaque product identifier. Full
provenance, artifacts, child records, and internal routing remain in typed structured
content or the canonical resource document.

The platform Task status URI remains the lifecycle identity. It answers how work
progressed. The domain `result_uri` identifies the completed product. A result names
both roles explicitly when both are present. A task that produces no addressable domain
product is not forced to invent a resource.

### 5.3 Keep discovery domain-specific and bounded

Every growing collection exposes stable pagination through its owning domain types.
Older known items remain reachable by canonical URI or exact domain identity without
loading the current full collection. Index responses carry only the domain-owned
discriminator fields needed to select an item. Filters, limits, sort order, and opaque
cursors remain typed in the server that understands them.

The agent kernel owns cumulative episode resource-read budgets. The shared MCP layer
owns serialized response-size enforcement and conformance checks. Apply the byte cap
after final MCP serialization rather than estimating Rust heap size. An oversized result
fails before transport with a machine-readable budget diagnostic. Structured content
appears once. Text carries only a short identity-free status unless the protocol
requires a human-readable explanation.

Begin with characterization tests for Optimization and one other task-heavy server.
Continue only into domains whose tests expose an unbounded collection, competing result
identity, duplicate presentation, or missing exact lookup. Static well-known documents
and already-canonical domain resources remain unchanged.

### Resource acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| identity audit | each product has one domain-owned canonical URI and no hash-derived parallel public identity |
| canonical handoff | an addressable terminal product contains one domain result URI and no competing product identifier in text |
| no-product task | a terminal task without an addressable product does not fabricate a resource URI |
| exact lookup | an older known canonical URI or domain ID resolves without listing the full collection |
| pagination | each changed growing index returns stable order and an opaque domain-owned cursor |
| duplicate presentation | the model sees structured payload once and a short status beside it |
| response cap | serialization beyond the limit produces no partial response |
| episode budget | read count, family count, bytes, time, and page depth fail independently |
| correction | an unknown canonical URI reports only the requested URI and safe copy-and-retry guidance |

## Phase 6: Provider-Neutral Reasoning Controls

This optional track starts only when an agent-manifest owner needs explicit reasoning
control for an admitted provider and model. The approval records the endpoint class,
models, required modes, and operational reason. Veoveo does not add configuration merely
because a provider exposes a wire field.

### 6.1 Model the three states

Represent omitted reasoning as `None` at the manifest field. A present value is a closed
`ReasoningMode`:

- `Disabled`, rendered only when the provider profile declares an exact supported wire
  value.
- `Effort(ReasoningEffort)`, where the closed repository enum is `Minimal`, `Low`,
  `Medium`, `High`, `XHigh`, or `Max`. Each provider capability profile admits an exact
  subset.

Omission preserves the provider default. Disabled does not mean low effort. No mode
injects a preamble, changes sampling, selects a different model, or removes tools.

### 6.2 Validate the provider profile

Add a closed endpoint class and capability profile beside model configuration. The
profile records whether reasoning is unsupported, disable-capable, or effort-capable,
and names its admitted levels. Provider-specific wire fields remain in the adapter.
Manifest loading rejects a mode that the selected endpoint class or model does not
support.

The rendered diagnostic surface reports endpoint class, effective model ID, reasoning
state, tool availability, and non-secret sampling controls. It excludes the API key,
authorization headers, provider response bodies, and base URLs containing credentials.

### Reasoning acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| omitted | no reasoning field is emitted and provider defaults remain untouched |
| disabled | the exact provider-supported disable value reaches the request with tools enabled |
| named effort | every admitted level renders exactly and retains tool schemas |
| unsupported | manifest validation fails before the agent connects |
| restart | the same manifest produces the same effective reasoning diagnostic |
| no fallback | an unsupported response does not retry with another mode, model, endpoint, or sampling configuration |

The reference patch's `none`-only enum is not an intermediate state. The implementation
lands the full closed model and capability validation in one hard cut.

## Phase 7: Evidence-Gated Accelerator Memory Admission

### 7.1 Qualify the need before changing the schema

This track does not begin from a proposed schema. First capture the exact same-device
group, physical device or MIG profile, workload replicas, model and runtime revisions,
steady reservations, transient operations, and observed NVML peaks. The evidence must
show that device identity and replica-count admission alone cannot prevent an unsafe
co-location.

The gate requires a reproducible hardware scenario that fails the proposed headroom
rule on the current profile, a named owner for every reservation, and an architecture
review of the capacity model. Mocked CUDA and estimated vendor marketing numbers cannot
satisfy it. If the current placement is already exclusive or comfortably bounded, this
track remains closed.

Only an accepted gate may add memory fields to `GpuWorkloadPlacement`. That change uses
the next available deployment profile and lock version at implementation time. The plan
does not reserve v7, v8, or a dependency on selected-release development scope.

### 7.2 Add conservative typed reservations

The accepted profile change extends each affected `GpuWorkloadPlacement` with typed
positive MiB reservations:

- persistent memory held while the workload is ready.
- peak memory required during its admitted maximum operation.
- an exact workload/model/runtime revision that qualifies those values.

Persistent memory cannot exceed peak memory. A group declares its minimum unallocated
headroom. Full-device capacity comes from qualified DRA device inventory and a matching
NVML hardware probe. MIG capacity comes from the admitted MIG profile and the allocated
partition. Missing or inconsistent capacity fails closed.

### 7.3 Use conservative peak admission

The first implementation admits a same-device group only when the sum of every replica's
declared peak plus group headroom fits the selected physical device or MIG partition.
This conservative rule requires no cross-service runtime scheduler and prevents an
unsafe overlap before startup.

Do not claim serialized transient admission until a durable shared admission service
owns leases across Reason, View, Stream, simulation, and Optimization. Such a service is
a separate design and is not required for the first memory-safe profile.

The Reason vLLM `gpuMemoryUtilization` remains explicit and schema-validated. Its
qualified memory reservation must agree with the selected model and device capacity.
The cuOpt RMM pool, renderer allocations, simulation baseline, inference engines, and
encode/decode reservations receive their own workload entries rather than inheriting a
generic GPU number.

### 7.4 Report reservations and observations

Deployment diagnostics show physical UUID, partition identity, total memory, declared
persistent and peak reservations, headroom, and current observed use. Observed use is
evidence and drift detection. It never grants admission beyond the declaration.

Pod replacement and release upgrade re-evaluate the same locked memory plan before the
new process starts. A changed model digest or runtime revision invalidates its previous
qualification.

### GPU acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| schema | zero, persistent-above-peak, unknown revision, and missing headroom fail validation |
| unsafe group | summed peak beyond qualified capacity is rejected before workload startup |
| device proof | DRA allocation, in-container UUID, NVML capacity, and profile capacity agree |
| MIG proof | partition profile and allocatable bytes agree with the locked reservation |
| pod replacement | the replacement receives the same physical identity and passes admission again |
| release upgrade | changed workload revision requires matching new memory evidence |
| real concurrency | resident and transient workloads reach peak on hardware without allocation failure |
| fallback audit | no CPU, alternate model, alternate runtime, or unselected GPU path appears |

Acceptance requires an accessible NVIDIA GPU. Mocked CUDA, software rendering, and a
container that merely exposes an `nvidia.com/gpu` resource cannot close this phase.

## Phase 8: Compiler-Ready Frames And Time Provenance

### 8.1 Add a shared digest type

Introduce one general `Sha256Digest` in the shared contract rather than reusing the
gateway-specific `CompositionDigest` or adding another unconstrained string. It accepts
only `sha256:` followed by 64 lowercase hexadecimal digits. Migrate touched provenance
fields to this type in the same hard cut. Unrelated legacy strings can move when their
own contracts change.

### 8.2 Report only Frames revisions actually used

Add `FrameSourceReference` with revision URI, revision ID, and `Sha256Digest` to the
Frames output. Instrument source and target resolution to collect a set when a world
revision participates in a point conversion. Sort and deduplicate that used set before
returning it.

Do not return every revision loaded into `ResolvedWorlds`. A resolver may prefetch more
than the operation consumes. WGS84-to-ECEF conversion without a world revision returns
an empty source list and retains the coordinate-operation provenance.

Direct and Task-based conversion return the same reference shape. Artifact metadata and
usage records include the canonical source references without a second descriptive
identity.

### 8.3 Return effective Time authority

Add typed references for the effective TZDB and leap-second releases. Each reference
contains its canonical `time://` release URI, release ID, source ID, immutable source
digest, version label, and acquisition identity when the release came through the
acquisition workflow. Bootstrap data uses an explicit bootstrap source kind rather than
pretending that an acquisition occurred.

Every deterministic conversion returns the authority pair that actually governed it.
Clock-derived operations such as current time additionally return the effective clock
policy, observed quality, and holdover state. Deterministic conversion of a supplied
instant does not attach current node clock quality, because that observation did not
govern the calculation.

Approximation remains explicit in Frames. Time ambiguity and uncertainty remain typed
in Time. A downstream compiler copies the supplied references and verifies them against
its admitted revision set. It does not search unrelated catalogs by display name.

### Provenance acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| used Frames sources | source and target world revisions appear once. Prefetched unused revisions do not appear |
| no-world conversion | the source list is empty and operation provenance remains complete |
| digest type | malformed prefixes, uppercase hex, short values, and long values fail schema and runtime validation |
| Time data authority | conversion returns the exact active TZDB and leap release references and digests |
| clock authority | current-time output reports effective policy, quality, and holdover without changing deterministic conversion output |
| restart | persisted revisions produce byte-identical source references after restart |
| downstream admission | a compiler fixture accepts returned references without a catalog search and rejects an unadmitted digest |

Focused gates:

```sh
cargo test -p veoveo-mcp-contract
cargo test -p veoveo-frames-mcp
cargo test -p veoveo-time-mcp
```

## Phase 9: Private Git And Trust Inputs For Image Builds

This optional track starts only when a repository-managed builder must resolve an exact
private Git dependency. It does not make Veoveo's BuildKit workflow mandatory for an
external extension. A downstream publisher may continue to use its own build system and
join Veoveo through the published image, chart, fragment, binding, and conformance
contracts.

### 9.1 Define one operator interface

Use repository-owned names:

```text
VEOVEO_GIT_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/absolute/owner-only/path
VEOVEO_GIT_CA_BUNDLE_FILE=/absolute/owner-only/path
VEOVEO_GIT_HOST_ADDRESS=git.example.internal=192.0.2.10
```

The first two values are optional secret source files. The host mapping is optional
validated configuration, not a secret. It accepts exactly one DNS host and IP pair and
must match the host of a locked Git dependency. It cannot override a registry, model,
provider, or arbitrary build destination.

`xtask` requires absolute regular files, rejects symlinks, and checks owner-only mode for
the credential store. It parses the CA bundle before invoking Buildx. The execution plan
records only whether each optional input is present. Paths, file metadata beyond the
admitted mode, and bytes are excluded.

### 9.2 Separate fetch from compile

Every opted-in repository-managed Rust builder family performs a dependency-fetch step
with these optional mounts:

- `veoveo-git-credentials` at a fixed `/run/secrets` path.
- `veoveo-git-ca-bundle` at a fixed `/run/secrets` path.

The process configures Git's credential helper and CA path for that command only. TLS
verification remains enabled. Cargo uses the Git CLI for credential-helper support.
After fetch completes, the compile step runs offline without either secret mount.

Apply the same contract to each repository-managed family selected by the approved use
case. Prefer moving an opted-in standalone image onto a shared artifact family when that
removes duplicate build logic without changing its runtime base. Otherwise reuse the
exact secret IDs, process configuration, and tests. Do not modify an unrelated builder
merely to make every Dockerfile expose the option.

Build arguments cannot carry credentials or CA bytes. A missing credential causes the
immutable private revision fetch to fail. It never substitutes a public dependency,
mutable branch, or alternate registry source.

### 9.3 Prove evidence isolation

Acceptance uses a unique non-production canary credential and an empty dependency
cache. Scan image history, exported OCI filesystem, local and registry cache exports,
SBOM, maximum-mode provenance, image build plan, run evidence, BuildKit trace, stdout,
and stderr for the complete canary and its encoded forms.

The source URL remains credential-free in Cargo metadata and the lock. A cache may
contain fetched immutable source and a credential-free remote URL. It cannot contain a
credential helper file or authenticated URL.

### Build acceptance matrix

| Test | Required proof |
|---|---|
| clean cache | the locked private revision resolves with the secret in each opted-in repository builder family |
| missing credential | fetch fails closed without a fallback and without printing the credential-free URL as an authenticated URL |
| CA | the admitted custom root succeeds. Malformed or absent required trust fails with verification still enabled |
| host mapping | only the locked Git host can receive the single validated override |
| compile boundary | compile runs offline and has no secret mount |
| layer and cache scan | no canary bytes or helper file occur in image layers or exported cache |
| evidence scan | plan, run, trace, SBOM, provenance, logs, and metadata contain no canary bytes or source path |

Focused gates include `veoveo-image-build-control` tests and clean-cache qualified builds
for every opted-in repository-managed family. External build systems are outside this
gate. BuildKit versions remain exact.

## Phase 10: Core Closure And Independent Milestone Closure

### Source gates

Run focused gates with each commit. Before closing the core release or any independent
milestone that changes shared contracts, run the repository-wide non-visual source gate:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --lib --bins
```

Run Console tests, lint, and production build. Regenerate and validate every changed
JSON Schema, deployment example, compatibility manifest, and lock. Use
`git diff --check` and hard-cut searches for removed schema versions, old cursor
domains, old return-path type names, obsolete resource error constants, and abandoned
configuration fields.

### Integration gates

Run the core gates together. Run another row only when its independent milestone or
approved conditional track is closing.

| Track | Gate | Environment | Required result |
|---|---|---|---|
| core | agent recovery | Gateway, SurrealDB, short-lived OAuth issuer, and controlled crash points | one continuation and terminal receipt, same-episode correction, and preserved resource wakes |
| core | Secret closure | disposable Kubernetes/K3s cluster with API audit evidence | zero writes when an owner-supplied Secret or key is missing |
| core | spatial restart | pinned DuckDB Spatial extension and persistent test database | stable distance, order, and new cursor behavior after reopen |
| ergonomic | standalone App | headed hardware-backed browser and authenticated Gateway | cold return, shared CSP/sandbox/bridge, and one upstream listener across tabs |
| ergonomic | resource handoff | selected task-heavy servers and agent read ledger | one canonical domain result URI, exact lookup, bounded pagination, and independent budget failures |
| ergonomic | provenance | Frames and Time servers plus downstream compiler fixture | exact references admit directly without catalog search |
| optional | reasoning | approved provider/model matrix without production credentials | omitted and exact admitted modes render while unsupported configuration fails before connection |
| optional | private builds | managed BuildKit with empty local and registry caches | immutable fetch succeeds and canary scans remain empty in opted-in builders |
| evidence-gated | selected development scope | disposable cluster and independently owned release fixtures | the approved development driver issues no request for the unselected owner |
| evidence-gated | GPU admission | qualified NVIDIA DRA cluster and concurrent real workloads | declared peak fits hardware, survives replacement, and uses no fallback |

No integration gate may replace a missing event-driven path with provider polling,
resource polling, task polling beyond the official Tasks correctness contract, API-only
visual checks, or CPU rendering.

## Commit Plan

Each row is a reviewable green checkpoint after its focused red test has been observed.
A commit may split further when one concern grows, but adjacent rows must not collapse
ownership boundaries. Conditional rows do not enter the sequence before approval.

| Sequence | Track | Commit concern | Minimum coherent green result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | core | Rig listener/request surface | typed listener readiness and request freshness with its focused adapter test |
| 2 | core | agent listener rotation | acknowledged make-before-break listener, durable resource wakes, and token-rotation regression test |
| 3 | core | resource reads and safe diagnostics | bounded read adapter, final MCP error classification, redaction, and same-episode correction tests |
| 4 | core | continuation crash evidence | characterization matrix and a migration only if a baseline test proves a lineage gap |
| 5 | core | rendered Secret-reference closure | pure closure, distinct read failures, and API-audited zero-write tests without Secret creation |
| 6 | core | DuckDB spatial axis type | runtime setting, Map/DuckDB selections, and extension-backed failing-then-green test |
| 7 | core | Map distance query hard cut | typed score, materialized CTE, cursor hard cut, and restart regression test |
| 8 | ergonomic | standalone App route and auth return | typed route, authorized bootstrap, shared host, and route/auth tests |
| 9 | ergonomic | App stream bounds | characterization of existing fanout plus only the missing capacity, cleanup, and browser evidence |

## Documentation And Generated Artifact Closure

Each implementation commit updates its owning documentation. A phase is incomplete
when code and tests pass but its public or installation contract still describes the
old behavior.

Required documentation updates include:

- `mcp/contract/DESIGN.md` for resource errors, canonical URI handoff, shared bounds, and
  conformance without a universal resource identity.
- `docs/RMCP_3_MIGRATION.md` if the post-migration listener repair changes its
  implementation report or remaining rollout evidence.
- `docs/AUTONOMY_HARNESS.md` and `docs/TECH_DESIGN.md` for delivered continuation and
  model behavior.
- `deploy/contract/DESIGN.md` and `docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES.md` for the required
  Secret-reference closure and any later approved development-profile revision.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` only through an explicit replacement decision if a
  future proposal changes installation ownership. This plan does not make that change.
- `mcp/apps-extension/DESIGN.md` and Console documentation for the standalone host.
- Map, Frames, Time, Reason, and Optimization `DESIGN.md` files for their owned
  contract changes.
- `docs/IMAGE_BUILDS.md` and `docs/EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY_INTEGRATION.md` for private
  dependency inputs.
- `docs/CODEMAP.md` whenever a module, document, component, or ownership boundary is
  added or moved.

Generated schemas, compatibility manifests, example profiles, deployment locks, Helm
values schemas, and conformance fixtures change only when their source types change.
Generated outputs are never edited independently of their typed owner. An internal
validation addition does not force a public schema revision.

## Definition Of Done

### Core correctness release

The required program is complete when its red evidence has been observed, its permanent
tests pass, and these claims are simultaneously true:

- resource notifications remain active across initial connection, token rotation,
  process restart, and lease handoff.
- correctable resource and domain input errors can be repaired within one bounded
  episode without leaking protected diagnostics.
- continuation crash points produce one terminal wake, one consume transaction, and one
  durable receipt, or baseline characterization proves the delivered transaction already
  supplies that result.
- a failed rendered Secret-reference closure causes no Kubernetes or Helm mutation and
  repository tooling creates or rewrites no Secret.
- Map uses the explicit longitude/latitude axis and new cursor domain on every open.
- hard-cut searches find no old cursor reader, obsolete protocol constant, CPU fallback,
  universal resource token, Secret-management path, or provider status polling.

### Independent ergonomic milestones

Each milestone closes without waiting for the others:

- standalone Apps share the Console security, identity, sandbox, bridge, and stream
  boundaries.
- addressable task products expose one canonical domain result URI with bounded exact
  lookup, discovery, serialization, and agent reads.
- Frames and Time return exact typed source references consumed directly by a downstream
  compiler.

### Optional and evidence-gated tracks

An optional track is done only after its recorded approval and tests pass:

- reasoning modes are explicit, provider-admitted, restart-stable, and never silently
  substituted.
- private Git credentials and trust inputs never escape the opted-in dependency-fetch
  secret mounts, while external builders remain independent.

An evidence-gated track is done only after its gate and hardware or cluster acceptance:

- selected development iteration, if approved, cannot issue an installation request for
  an unselected ownership key and does not enter enterprise contracts.
- GPU memory admission, if approved, uses qualified revision-specific reservations and
  real NVIDIA capacity without a CPU, alternate-model, or software fallback.

No optional or evidence-gated row blocks the core correctness release or an unrelated
ergonomic milestone.
