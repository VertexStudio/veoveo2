# Veoveo reference architecture

This directory is the isolated Veoveo UAF 1.3 and SysML 1.6 reference
architecture. It contains no client-specific mission data and is not integrated
into the whitepaper or a white-label publication.

The architecture covers every buildable first-party component and every
external runtime that participates in the stated platform architecture. The
component catalog includes all 42 Rust workspace packages, the React console,
the Python SDK and hosted-server template, internal Python and C++ executors,
deployment and verification components, and required or optional external
runtimes.

## Review files

- `index.html` is the offline browser portal and canonical report source.
- `veoveo-reference-architecture.pdf` is the fixed-layout formal review copy.
- `diagrams/*.svg` contains eleven individually reusable vector views.
- `catalogs/software-components.csv` enumerates 68 scoped software resources.
- `catalogs/interfaces-and-protocols.csv` defines 43 canonical interfaces.
- `catalogs/requirements-traceability.csv` traces 20 requirements to capability,
  activity, service, resource, and evidence.
- `catalogs/model-glossary.csv` fixes the terms used across the package.

Open the portal directly:

```bash
open docs/architecture/index.html
```

Open an individual vector view in a browser or vector application:

```bash
open docs/architecture/diagrams/05-software-resource-structure.svg
```

## Model exchange

`model/veoveo-uaf-sysml.xmi` is the tool-neutral semantic exchange source. It
applies the official OMG UAF 1.3 and SysML 1.6 profile URIs and contains stable
capability, operational activity, service, software, actual-resource,
requirement, and traceability identities. `model/model-manifest.yaml` records
the standards, provenance, validation posture, and known exchange boundary.

The XMI deliberately contains no vendor-specific diagram notation. Import it
into a UAF 1.3-capable modeling tool, resolve the official profiles, run that
tool's UAF/SysML validation, and save the resulting native project. The
published SVGs remain the layout-controlled review views. See
`model/MODEL-IMPORT.md`.

This release validates XML well-formedness, unique XMI identifiers, internal
references, catalog coverage, cross-catalog identifiers, HTML links, PDF text,
and rendered page layout. It does not claim vendor-certified UAF conformance or
native-project round-trip fidelity before the documented import validation.

## Client sharing

The generated release directory contains two packages:

- `veoveo-reference-architecture-0.3.0-review.zip` contains HTML, PDF, SVG,
  catalogs, the README, release manifest, and checksums. It requires no modeling
  software.
- `veoveo-reference-architecture-0.3.0-model-exchange.zip` adds XMI, the model
  manifest, and import guidance for a client's architecture team.

Before release, apply the contract's distribution, export-control, CUI, and
classification markings. Put client-specific capabilities, organizations,
systems, configurations, requirements, and risks in a separate overlay. Send
controlled material only through the client's approved exchange environment.

## Regeneration

The architecture tools use the locked `uv` project in this directory. The lock
pins PDF parsing, PDFium rendering, image processing, and code-quality tools;
the scripts do not depend on default site packages or an ambient virtual
environment.

Install the exact environment and render the generic model:

```bash
uv sync --project docs/architecture --locked
uv run --project docs/architecture --locked python docs/architecture/tools/render.py
uv run --project docs/architecture --locked python docs/architecture/tools/validate.py
```

Render the PDF from `index.html` with headed hardware-backed Chrome after
regeneration. Before `Page.printToPDF`, probe WebGPU and WebGL when the browser
exposes them and prove that at least one API reaches hardware. Stop when neither
API does. SwiftShader, llvmpipe, and other software renderers are never hardware
evidence. Never edit the generated SVG, XMI, HTML, PDF, or release archives as
an alternate source of truth.

Render every PDF page and a review contact sheet through the pinned PDFium and
Pillow stack:

```bash
uv run --project docs/architecture --locked python docs/architecture/tools/qa.py --clean
```

Client-specific generators, recipes, assets, and identifiers belong only under
the ignored `docs/whitelabel/` boundary. The generic architecture tools do not
discover, name, render, validate, or package client editions. Validation also
enforces the canonical generic-tool allowlist and rejects additional Python
modules in this directory.
