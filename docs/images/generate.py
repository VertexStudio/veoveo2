"""Generate the Autonomy Harness schematic figures via WaveSpeed GPT Image 2.

The STYLE anchor and per-figure prompts below are the canonical Veoveo doc-image
style: engineering schematic, white background, uniform thin dark slate line
work, flat 2D, and exactly one amber accent placed only where it carries
meaning. Keep new figures in this voice.

Usage:
    uv run --env-file .env --python 3.13 docs/images/generate.py [figure ...]

With no arguments every figure regenerates; naming figures regenerates only
those. Outputs land beside this script. Review every output for label accuracy
before shipping - the model likes duplicating node labels, and countable
geometries (a pentagon, a three-by-three grid) hold label counts far better
than rings.
