# Enterprise deployment

Veoveo ships Kubernetes software as OCI images and Helm charts. The installation
owner supplies the cluster, registry access, configuration repository, secrets,
identity, ingress, and reconciliation controller. This boundary keeps a customer
installation recognizable to a Kubernetes platform team and prevents the product
repository from becoming the owner of customer infrastructure.

Helm is the package contract. GitOps is the recommended reconciliation model, with
Flux as the maintained reference. An operator may use another controller or direct Helm without
changing the chart, image, configuration, or Secret contracts.

The ordered installation procedure for operators and agents is documented in the
[deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md). This document remains the normative ownership
and artifact contract.

The [enterprise discovery template](ENTERPRISE_DISCOVERY_TEMPLATE.md) records the
business and operating inputs that precede this contract. The
[enterprise installation runbook](ENTERPRISE_INSTALLATION_RUNBOOK.md) connects those
approved inputs to solution design, artifact selection, reconciliation, acceptance,
and handoff without changing the ownership rules below. The
[enterprise installation readiness record](ENTERPRISE_INSTALLATION_READINESS.md)
captures the installation's decisions, evidence, defects, limitations, and approvals.

## Ownership

| Concern | Owner | Durable source |
|---|---|---|
| Source compilation and image construction | Each source repository | Independent Git revision and repository-local image graph |
| Runtime images | OCI publisher | Registry manifests addressed by digest |
| Platform and extension packages | OCI publisher | Versioned Helm chart artifacts |
| Installation configuration | Installation owner | Private Git repository |
| Credentials and private keys | Installation owner | Secret manager and Kubernetes Secret projections |
| Cluster prerequisites | Installation platform team | Cluster platform repository |
| Application reconciliation | Installation GitOps controller | Declared source, Kustomization, and release objects |
| Acceptance evidence | Installation release process | Rust smoke, conformance, and operational evidence |

The [Autonomy Harness](AUTONOMY_HARNESS.md) defines the continuous containment boundary,
complete shared-responsibility matrix, and end-to-end operating proof for agents that
remain autonomous throughout the installation lifecycle. Helm readiness establishes
workload health, and the gateway independently probes each hosted server's declared
health endpoint so a degraded server surfaces in the Console; the harness evidence
proves that each effect stays inside its declared authority while agents keep running.

The build pipeline publishes artifacts. It does not connect to customer clusters.
The configuration repository selects published artifacts. It does not compile
Veoveo. The reconciliation controller reads the desired state and applies it to the
cluster. The smoke harness verifies the resulting installation without owning it.

## Installation Addressing

The installation owner chooses the canonical client-facing origin, for example
`https://veoveo.example.internal`. The name may resolve only through private DNS, an
internal load balancer, or a VPN. It remains distinct from the private OCI registry and
package-index coordinates.

`global.publicBaseUrl`, ingress hosts, OAuth protected resources, redirect URIs, and
gateway issuer metadata derive from that one installation-owned origin. No Veoveo
artifact embeds a universal service hostname, and private deployment does not require a
public Veoveo control plane.

Artifact downloads, Console downloads, and public-share bearers also remain on that
origin. RustFS or an external S3-compatible service is private installation
infrastructure. It has no client-facing ingress, DNS requirement, or presigned delivery
contract.

## Release artifacts

One installation release may combine several independently published sources.
Production Helm values address images by digest; a mutable tag is not a production
identity. Each source builds, tests, certifies, and publishes its own image, chart,
gateway fragment, and release manifest.

The installation release procedure follows the
[external-repository runbook](EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY_INTEGRATION.md):

1. Verify the selected Veoveo compatibility manifest and extension-release manifests.
2. Check that every extension selects the installed compatibility release.
3. Pin image and chart digests in the installation's ordinary Helm values and GitOps
   release objects.
4. Compose installation-owned bindings with the selected gateway fragments.
5. Satisfy the generated typed platform requirements and render every chart.
6. Commit the complete desired-state change for normal reconciliation.

The Veoveo source provides a conventional private chart publisher:

~~~bash
REVISION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
CHART_VERSION=0.1.0-$(git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD)

cargo xtask release helm-charts \
  --registry registry.example.internal/veoveo/charts \
  --version "$CHART_VERSION" \
  --revision "$REVISION"
~~~

An internal development registry may explicitly enable plain HTTP. A fielded registry
uses TLS, authentication, immutable tags, retention policy, and vulnerability scanning
supplied by the installation owner.

Veoveo's profile publisher remains available for development and source-publication
acceptance. The profile may live in a separate installation repository without making
`xtask` part of the fielded runtime or GitOps contract. It is documented in
[`LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES.md`](LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES.md) and is not required in an
installation repository.

Direct group publication remains available to Veoveo release pipelines. A Veoveo-backed
extension platform uses `external-extension-platform`; the canonical simulation base
and overlays use their dedicated groups. The simulation image group is an ABI and GPU
certification boundary, not proof that Frames, Map, Media, Optimization, or RRD
services were installed. The installation's typed chart selection and composed gateway
requirements supply that proof.

The canonical simulation runtime is a separate build dependency because UAV and
external simulator overlays consume it as a named build context. The deployment
profile derives the exact required platform targets and records their combined
immutable closure.

## Configuration repository

An enterprise configuration repository should contain only installation-owned desired
state:

~~~text
clusters/
  production/
    platform/                 cluster prerequisites and controller configuration
    applications/             root and child reconciliation objects
    values/
      veoveo.yaml             installation identity, capacity, storage, ingress
      extension.yaml          independently deployed domain extension values
      images.yaml             reviewed image repositories and manifest digests
    releases/
      extension.json          selected immutable extension-release manifest
    gateway/
      base.json               installation-owned platform control plane
      bindings/               installation-owned extension exposure and policy
      fragments.lock.json     immutable extension fragment selection
      control-plane.json      deterministic composed output
      public-jwks.json
~~~

Helm values own chart inputs. Kubernetes manifests own resources outside a chart.
The gateway base and bindings own platform exposure and authorization. Extensions own
server fragments in their release artifacts. `gateway-compose` produces the complete
validated control plane and content provenance offline. The GitOps controller may
generate ConfigMaps from committed non-secret outputs. There is no second installation
document that repeats releases, values files, Secret keys, and apply order.

Environment overlays use the native composition mechanism chosen by the enterprise:
Helm values, Kustomize, or the GitOps controller's generator. One setting has one
canonical owner. A value is not copied into a general repository configuration file
merely because one installation needs it.

The Console public OAuth identity and its network route have separate installation
ownership. Keep `consoleBff.oauthResource` at the public protected-resource URL and set
`consoleBff.mcpTransportUrl` to the endpoint reachable by the BFF pod. Corporate roots
belong in a non-secret installation ConfigMap selected by
`consoleBff.outboundCa.existingConfigMap`; the chart mounts its configured PEM key and
the BFF adds those roots to the standard verifier. A deployment/v6 source lists the
owning values file under the platform release's `installationValues`. Missing ConfigMap
data blocks the pod mount, while malformed trust material blocks BFF startup.

## Secrets

Charts reference existing Kubernetes Secrets. Secret bytes never enter Helm values,
Git, a Flux Kustomization, or a generated ConfigMap. An enterprise may project those
Secrets with External Secrets Operator, Secrets Store CSI Driver, Sealed Secrets, or
its established platform mechanism.

The platform chart expects these Secret contracts by default:

| Secret | Required keys |
|---|---|
| veoveo-surreal-admin | username, password |
| veoveo-surreal-runtime | username, password |
| veoveo-installation-secrets | internal-signing-key-der-b64, internal-signing-key-id, internal-trust-jwks, oidc-client-secret, authorization-server-private-key-der-b64, refresh-delivery-key-b64, console-session-key, recording-playback-token-key, object-store-access-key, object-store-secret-key, media-provider-api-key, google-maps-api-key, media-provider-webhook-secret |

An extension declares its own least-privilege Secret references. It does not add
provider credentials to the platform Secret merely for convenience. Registry
credentials use a Kubernetes image pull Secret selected through Helm values.

Flux repository credentials are also platform Secrets. They authorize Flux to read
the enterprise Git and OCI repositories; they are not application credentials.

`recording-playback-token-key` is independent base64 text that decodes to exactly
32 random bytes. It signs only recording-scoped Redap read tokens and must not reuse a
gateway, refresh-delivery, Console session, object-store, or provider key.

## Controller boundary

The enterprise owns the GitOps controller. Veoveo applications must not install,
upgrade, configure, or delete that controller. A local reference environment may
bootstrap a pinned Flux version as a platform fixture, but the root Veoveo
Kustomization begins only after the controller and its repository credentials exist.

A root Kustomization may create the installation namespace, non-secret ConfigMaps,
ingress connectors, OCI sources, and HelmReleases. The platform chart is one release.
Each optional private MCP extension is another release with its own chart version,
values, health, rollback, and lifecycle.

The controller reconciles drift continuously. Routine releases change Git and let the
controller converge. kubectl apply and helm upgrade are bootstrap and recovery tools,
not concurrent owners of the same application resources.

## Independently deployed MCP extensions

An extension packages its Kubernetes workload in its own Helm chart. The installation
adds a HelmRelease for that chart, selects its immutable release manifest, and
binds its gateway fragment through installation-owned policy. The deterministic
composer registers routes and capabilities in the complete control plane. This
separates scheduling and rollout while preserving one MCP authority and one
authorization boundary.

An extension release normally selects two artifacts:

- the immutable OCI chart version;
- the installation Git repository containing values, bindings, and digest pins.

Every fragment's upstream declares two typed URLs: the MCP endpoint and a required
`health_url`. The gateway probes the health endpoint with an unauthenticated GET and
treats only a success status as healthy; it never reads an MCP request, an
authentication failure, or a method rejection as a health signal. A fragment without
`health_url` fails control-plane validation before it can deploy.

Private MCP servers follow the same pattern. They use their repository's native build
system and do not join the Veoveo workspace. Their chart consumes the versioned
`veoveo-extension` library from the configured private OCI registry or verified offline
bundle. Their gateway fragment still uses the canonical typed control-plane model,
internal assertion trust, policy checks, audit path, and URI identities. The complete
normative server requirements, including the well-known docs and contract resources,
are in
[`mcp/contract/DESIGN.md`](../mcp/contract/DESIGN.md).

## Direct Helm

Flux is not a runtime dependency of Veoveo. An enterprise with another release
controller can render or install the same packages directly:

~~~bash
helm upgrade --install veoveo \
  oci://registry.example.com/veoveo/charts/veoveo \
  --version "$CHART_VERSION" \
  --namespace veoveo \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values/veoveo.yaml \
  --values values/images.yaml \
  --wait
~~~

The operator must apply the gateway ConfigMap and provision every referenced Secret
before Helm starts workloads. Another GitOps system should express those same ordering
and ownership boundaries rather than translating them into a Veoveo-specific
orchestrator.

## Upgrade and rollback

A release change updates selected release manifests, chart versions, and image digests
in one reviewed commit.
Automated reconciliation may self-heal configuration drift, but promotion between
environments remains an explicit Git change. Rollback restores the previous known-good
manifests and digests. Database migration compatibility belongs to release notes and
must be evaluated before promotion.

A production gate checks controller health, application sync, pod readiness, persistent
storage, ingress, OAuth discovery, MCP capability discovery, hosted-server health
endpoints, and required GPU capacity.
Domain acceptance then exercises the installed workload through its public contract.
