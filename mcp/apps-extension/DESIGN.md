# MCP Apps Contract Design

This document is the canonical contract for how domain MCP servers ship
user-facing views and administrative surfaces to Veoveo hosts (the Console
today, any MCP Apps host tomorrow). The crate `veoveo-mcp-apps-extension`
owns the pinned protocol constants and helpers; this document owns the rules.

## Status

Implemented in this workspace.

## Standards And Protocols

| Standard or protocol | Implemented profile |
|---|---|
| [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) | App discovery and invocation remain ordinary MCP resource, tool, and task traffic. The hosting path uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP. |
| MCP Apps SEP-1865 / `ext-apps` | Version `2026-01-26`, with `ui://` resources, `text/html;profile=mcp-app`, tool-to-app metadata, host context, lifecycle notifications, and the `postMessage` bridge. |
| Veoveo reactive App resource adapter | Repository-owned extension over MCP Apps `2026-01-26`. A sandboxed App requests an authorized resource filter through one final-profile `subscriptions/listen` stream; the Console projects contentless `ui/notifications/resource-updated` wakes from its auth-scoped MCP client. This adapter is not claimed as part of SEP-1865. |
| Veoveo internal App navigation adapter | Repository-owned `ui/open-link` profile. Exact `ui://` targets navigate only when present in the caller-visible App catalog; `veoveo-console://agents` and `veoveo-console://recordings` are the only platform-view targets. Other custom, missing, or unexposed targets fail closed. |
| Veoveo App agent-message adapter | Repository-owned `veoveo/agents/message` profile. An App resource declares exact targets in `_meta["io.veoveo/agent-message-targets"]`; the Console validates that declaration and submits only UUIDv7-idempotent bounded text through its existing authenticated human-message BFF path. This adapter is not part of SEP-1865. |
| MCP Tasks extension `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` | Version `2026-07-28`; app-started durable work retains the same task lifecycle and ownership rules as a normal MCP client. |
| [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/) | Linked tool arguments and structured results use the same canonical schemas exposed outside the app. |
| HTML iframe sandbox and Content Security Policy | HTML runs in an opaque-origin `sandbox="allow-scripts"` frame. The default CSP denies remote network access while permitting local `data:` fetches; a live-data App may declare exact origins through `_meta.ui.csp`, which the host validates before adding them. Cookies, storage, and same-origin privilege remain absent. |

## The rule

A domain server's entire operational surface crosses exactly one protocol
boundary: MCP.

- **Reads are resources.** Domain state an operator or app needs is a
  `{slug}://…` resource (plus templates for addressable entities).
- **Mutations are tools.** Administrative writes are ordinary MCP tools,
  scope-gated inside the server and policy-gated at the gateway.
- **Views are app resources.** Interactive UI ships as a self-contained HTML
  document at `ui://{slug}/{page}` with MIME `text/html;profile=mcp-app`
  (SEP-1865 / ext-apps "2026-01-26").

Domain servers must not expose bespoke admin REST routers, and hosts must not
hardcode domain pages, domain nav entries, or domain proxy routes. If a
domain needs UI, it ships an app; if it needs new operations, it ships tools.
The Console's platform-plane views (overview, work, artifacts, agents,
recordings, MCP, apps, access, audit, cluster) are the only compiled-in
views: they render installation-generic state, never one server's domain
vocabulary.

## Server obligations

A server shipping a view (see `servers/timeseries-mcp` and
`servers/map-mcp` for reference implementations):

1. Declare the extension: `extend_capabilities(&mut caps)` in `get_info`.
2. List the view: `app_resource(uri, name)` in `list_resources`, with
   `.with_title(...)`, `.with_description(...)`, and optionally
   `.with_icons(...)` (data: URIs — hosts render nav/catalog entries from
   these fields, so they are the server-owned menu contribution).
3. Serve the view: `app_html_contents(uri, include_str!(...))` from
   `read_resource`. The document stays self-contained unless its function
   requires a declared live-data connection. Such a view uses
   `app_resource_with_meta` and lists exact installation-owned origins in
   `_meta.ui.csp`; it does not name wildcards, paths, credentials, queries, or
   fragments.
4. Link tools: `link_tool_to_app(tool, uri, &[Model, App])` in `list_tools`
   for every tool the view may invoke. Tools without an app link are never
   app-callable.
5. Gate in-server: admin tools call `require_scope` with the domain admin
   scope (e.g. `map:admin`) exactly like any other scoped tool; resources
  carry the scope their data warrants.

## Host obligations

The hosting core (gateway + console BFF + console web) stays fully generic:

- **Host surfaces** — the Console shell and `/apps/{server}/{page...}` mount
  the same frame component, bridge, theme projection, resource adapters, and
  internal-link policy. The BFF parses the standalone path into one canonical
  `ui://{server}/{page...}` URI with a typed `ServerSlug`, then returns an App
  descriptor only when that exact resource is present in the caller-visible
  catalog. Browser code forwards its path and never derives App authority from
  it. The public no-store entry document gains no session authority. Its first
  JSON bootstrap uses the existing Console cookie and OAuth transition, and
  `BrowserReturnPath` returns a completed login only to a same-origin
  `/console/` or `/apps/` document. Standalone chrome displays the authorized
  App title and a Console return link; it does not expose the principal subject.
- **Gateway** — the server's catalog entry lists its tools in the manifest,
  exposes them per profile, applies `tools_call` policy rules, and registers
  `resource_projection: server_owned` so `ui://…` URIs project as
  `ui://{mounted-slug}/{page}`.
- **Catalog** — the BFF discovers apps dynamically from `resources/list`
  (`is_app_resource`), derives ownership from the `ui://{server}/…` prefix,
  and attaches only that server's app-visible linked tools. There is no
  manual registration step anywhere.
- **Frame** — app HTML is served same-origin with `default-src 'none'` into an
  `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts">`. The BFF validates every declared CSP
  origin, sorts and deduplicates the result, and adds only those exact sources
  to the relevant directive. Local `data:` fetches do not add a remote network
  origin. The opaque origin has no cookies, storage, or same-origin privilege.
  Apps receive the complete Console content workspace by default. An explicit
  `_meta.ui.prefersBorder: true` requests the bordered presentation; absent or
  `false` metadata retains the full-workspace presentation.
- **Bridge** — the host declares `serverTools` and `serverResources`
  capabilities. `tools/call` from a view is proxied only to app-visible
  tools linked to that exact view on that view's server. Own-server resource
  reads remain implicit. A foreign `resources/read` must match one exact
  gateway-projected App dependency that names the owning App URI, target
  server, URI scheme and prefix, required scope, operation, and optional data
  labels. Gateway policy remains the authoritative second wall.
- **Tasks** — task-based tools stay task-based inside apps. A view may send
  `tools/call` with final request metadata plus `tasks/get`, `tasks/update`,
  and `tasks/cancel`; the console host intercepts these ahead of the
  AppBridge (which rejects task traffic) and proxies them through the BFF,
  which records task ownership per app view and forwards spec task requests
  on its gateway session. The same allowlists apply: only app-visible linked
  tools may start tasks, and a view may only poll tasks it started
  (`servers/view-mcp/assets/preview-app.template.html` is the reference
  task-driving view).
- **Reactive resources** — the Console intercepts App `subscriptions/listen`
  requests because MCP Apps `2026-01-26` does not include the final listener.
  The BFF registers UUID-bound references concurrently on the auth-scoped MCP
  client and returns one contentless authenticated SSE wake stream
  for the App's bounded subscription set. This multiplexed fetch stream avoids
  the browser's per-origin `EventSource` limit. Upstream
  `notifications/resources/updated` becomes
  `ui/notifications/resource-updated` inside the opaque frame. Reconnecting
  the stream reuses each UUID, and multiple frames retain independent
  references to the one upstream subscription. Healthy operation is
  notification-driven; bounded backoff runs only after the stream fails.
  Authorization expiry closes the stream. Each browser-session auth scope has
  configured ceilings for active upstream listeners and downstream browser
  registrations. Admission beyond either ceiling returns the typed
  `app_resource_capacity_exhausted` response without disturbing admitted
  streams. Access-token replacement cancels the old scope's listeners within
  the BFF bound before opening its replacement transport. Domain state never
  travels in the wake; the App reads current state through an explicitly
  settled ordinary bridge request.
- **Navigation** — the host's menu merges its static platform views with one
  entry per discovered app (label from the resource title, icon from the
  resource icons). Discovery failures are isolated by server and surface.
  Healthy Apps remain available beside a typed degradation notice, and a
  failed server never blocks the shell or the rest of the catalog.
- **Context links** — an App may send `ui/open-link` for another exact `ui://`
  resource or one of the two declared platform targets. The Console resolves
  App targets against its current caller-visible catalog and never accepts a
  browser-supplied server alias or arbitrary Console route.
- **Always-on agent messages** — an App may send `veoveo/agents/message` only
  when its listed resource declares that exact agent in
  `_meta["io.veoveo/agent-message-targets"]`. The bridge accepts a closed
  `{agentId, requestId, message}` object, requires a UUIDv7 request identity and
  at most 16 KiB of nonempty UTF-8 text, and forwards it to the ordinary
  same-origin BFF mutation. The BFF and gateway retain human identity, Work
  Context, CSRF, policy, audit, idempotency, and durable-wake authority. The
  iframe receives no cookie, gateway bearer, agent credential, or database
  access, and malformed metadata grants no targets. The Console projects the
  already validated target list into
  `hostContext._meta["io.veoveo/agent-message-targets"]` during App
  initialization, which lets a generic view render only its admitted choices.

## Governed Cross-Server Resources

Cross-server requirements are typed control-plane declarations, not
App-authored metadata. An extension may declare them in
`ServerManifest.app_resource_dependencies`; installation bindings still
decide whether the owner and target are exposed and which policy applies.
Each declaration binds one projected `ui://{owner}/...` App resource to one
registered target server and one non-root URI prefix under that server's
canonical scheme. The initial operation profile is `read`.

Control-plane validation rejects an unknown target server, a scheme not owned
by that server, an invalid App owner, a root or mismatched prefix, an unknown
data label, an empty operation set, and duplicate declarations. The gateway
filters valid declarations against the active profile, actor scopes, and actor
data labels before adding
`_meta["io.veoveo/app-resource-dependencies"]` to the listed App resource.
Dependencies are sorted for deterministic projection.

The Console trusts only that gateway projection. It re-lists the exact App
resource before each cross-server read and accepts the URI only when it matches
the projected scheme, prefix, and `read` operation. A browser-supplied server,
App URI, or resource URI cannot enlarge the declaration. The eventual
`resources/read` runs through the gateway under the same session and Work
Context, where profile exposure and resource policy authorize the exact
target.

## View obligations

The view side of the postMessage protocol (see
`servers/timeseries-mcp/assets/forecast-app.html` for the reference bridge):

- `ui/initialize` → apply `hostContext` (theme, display mode), then
  `ui/notifications/initialized`.
- Self-driving views load their own data through `resources/read` after
  initialize — a view must render meaningful content without waiting for a
  `tool-result` push.
- Report height via `ui/notifications/size-changed`; respond to
  `ui/resource-teardown`.
- Handle tool/resource failures inline (authorization errors surface as
  ordinary failed requests — degrade to read-only or show the error).
- A reactive view subscribes only to resources owned by its server, treats
  each update as a wake to read current state, and unsubscribes during
  teardown. It does not use a timer as a substitute for resource updates.

## Why not admin REST

The previous pattern (server-local admin REST + gateway
`/admin/{profile}/servers/{server}/{*path}` proxy + a hand-written console
page per domain) required four hardcoded integration points per domain:
console view, console nav entry, BFF proxy route, and server router. The
apps contract replaces all four with discovery. The generic gateway server
admin proxy remains for platform infrastructure, but domain servers must not
grow new REST surfaces behind it.
