# SUMO traffic-world showcase

This showcase connects a real [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/) traffic world to
Veoveo. A Rust MCP server owns the single serialized TraCI connection, publishes
typed Rerun frames to the Recording Hub, and exposes governed traffic reads,
actuation, durable tasks, resources, and subscriptions.

The bundled simulation is the MIT-licensed LuST Luxembourg scenario at a pinned
source revision. TraCI stays inside the Kubernetes cluster. The loopback MCP
projection requires the same gateway-signed Ed25519 identity assertion as every
other hosted server.

The upstream SUMO 1.27.1 image is published for `linux/amd64`. The showcase
images declare that architecture explicitly.

## Capabilities

- `query_state` and `describe_scenario` return typed live-world data.
- `set_signal_phase`, `reroute_vehicle`, `set_edge_speed`, `close_lane`,
  and `open_lane` mutate the serialized simulation.
- `run_batch` is a durable task. Its recovery class is
  `interrupted_indeterminate` because a live simulation advance cannot be
  replayed safely after an uncertain interruption.
- `generate_network`, `compute_routes`, and `optimize_signals` run SUMO
  programs as resumable durable tasks. Outputs enter the shared artifact plane
  through task-bound write capabilities.
- `sumo://state` and `sumo://scenario` are typed resources.
- `sumo://congestion` supports subscriptions and resource-update notifications.
- `/world/sumo/**` is pushed continuously through an authenticated recording
  forwarder and retained by Recording Hub.

Task state lives in the required SurrealDB 3.2.3 platform store. The server uses
official MCP Tasks and Veoveo's shared task runtime.

## Tests

The deterministic driver unit tests need only the pinned Rust toolchain:

```bash
cargo test -p veoveo-sumo-mcp
```

The in-process push smoke writes fake-driver frames through the real Recording Hub
durability boundary and queries the resulting RRD segments:

```bash
cargo xtask smoke sumo-push
```

The live verification targets the active k3d profile. It checks the unauthenticated
boundary, reads the live world, changes an edge speed, and advances a durable batch.
It then proves that Recording Hub retained the world, signs into Console through the
local Keycloak realm, loads the playback manifest, reads the History archive through
the required Redap surface, and consumes one complete framed RRD message from Live:

```bash
cargo xtask smoke sumo-verify --context k3d-veoveo-sumo
```

## Run in k3d

Use the latest versions pinned in `deploy/local/k3d/versions.env`. The cluster
profile requires a working NVIDIA container runtime even though SUMO itself does
not request a GPU. This proves that later GPU simulators and renderers can use the
same local cluster. Startup applies the profile's NVIDIA device-plugin manifest and
waits for allocatable GPU capacity before deployment.

```bash
PROFILE=showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json
LOCK=output/deployments/sumo/deployment.lock.json
REVISION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
cargo xtask smoke profile-validate --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask smoke profile-cluster-up --profile "$PROFILE"
cargo xtask release images \
  --profile "$PROFILE" \
  --profile-revision "$REVISION" \
  --lock-output "$LOCK"
cargo xtask smoke profile-up --profile "$PROFILE" --lock "$LOCK"
```

The local identity provider runs at
`http://localhost:8080/realms/veoveo-local`. Open Console at
`http://localhost:8780/console/` and sign in as `alice` with password
`keycloak-local-password`. These fixed credentials and the generated local CA belong
only to this disposable loopback profile. Fielded installations supply their own
identity provider, trust roots, clients, and credentials.

The profile derives the exact platform images and publishes the SUMO images through a
separate `workload` source. Publication configures the managed builder from the
profile's registry address and transport while retaining its existing cache.

Normal clients use the `operator` gateway profile at
`http://localhost:8780/mcp/operator`. They mint a scoped service token through
the configured OAuth token endpoint before inspecting the namespaced SUMO
surface through that gateway. The direct
authenticated verification endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8895/sumo/mcp`; it
exists for the Rust acceptance harness.

SUMO's TraCI server accepts one client. The chart deliberately has no TCP
readiness probe on port 8813 because a probe would consume that connection and
terminate the simulation. `sumo-mcp` owns connection readiness and retries while
the LuST network loads.

The showcase chart leaves telemetry disabled because the minimal local platform
does not install a collector. Set `telemetry.enabled=true` and configure its
endpoint when a profile installs the collector.

`sumo-mcp` sends native Rerun traffic only to the forwarder on pod loopback.
The forwarder keeps its bounded durable queue on
`sumo-recording-forwarder`, authenticates to the canonical gateway with the
`sumo-recording-producer` private key, and uses the internal gateway Service as
its transport route. The public OAuth issuer, protected-resource URI,
assertion audience, and Host identity remain `http://localhost:8780`.

Remove the composed platform and showcase releases with
`cargo xtask smoke profile-down --profile showcase/sumo/deploy/deployment.json`.
The shared registry remains available for another profile. Local deployment mechanics
are documented in
[`../../docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES.md`](../../docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES.md).
