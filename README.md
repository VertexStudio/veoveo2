Veoveo is an operations platform for physical AI. Teams run agents that
observe the physical world, rehearse in simulated worlds, act on real
systems, and turn everything that happened into operational intelligence.
The organization deploying Veoveo owns the whole installation: cluster,
identity, storage, models, policies, domain name, and release process.

## What Teams Do With It

- **Fly the mission before flying it.** Launch
  [multirotor missions](#uav-flight-in-isaac-sim) over photorealistic
  terrain, with real flight dynamics and PX4 autopilot firmware, and keep
  the entire run as a dataset.
- **Operate a city's traffic.** Read live traffic state, retime signals,
  reroute vehicles, and replay outcomes against a full simulated city.
- **See through cameras.** Run detection and tracking over authorized video
  streams on your own GPUs.
- **See the whole operation.** Stream camera, telemetry, and vehicle state
  from field work into one governed timeline, from a single sensor to a
  working fleet.
- **Ask what happened.** Pose questions over synchronized recordings — world
  state, sensors, poses, annotations on one timeline — and get grounded,
  audited answers.
- **Forecast, plan, and analyze.** Timeseries forecasts with uncertainty,
  GPU vehicle routing and mathematical optimization with independently
  verified solutions, and SQL over operational data.
- **Hand evidence to anyone.** Every result becomes an artifact with
  ownership, provenance, and release state, shareable through expiring,
  revocable links.
- **Build agentic apps.** Ship interactive apps where agents do the work
  behind a live interface. Each app inherits the installation's identity,
  policy, access, and audit from its first request.

The same installation serves any team whose operations touch the physical
world, from logistics and defense to first responders:

Civic monitoring · Energy & utilities · Industrial operations ·
Construction sites · Ports & terminals · Conservation patrols ·

## Worlds You Can Trust

Physical AI is only as good as its model of the world. Veoveo treats world
models as governed infrastructure: authoritative geography and civil time,
photorealistic 3D scenes streamed from live tiles, simulated cities,
terrain, and airspace with real vehicle dynamics, and continuous recordings
of what actually happened. Agents reach simulation and reality through the same
interfaces, so a mission rehearsed in a synthetic world carries over to
operations in the real one.

## From Instruction To Intelligence

The product of the platform is operational intelligence: answers, forecasts,
plans, and evidence that an enterprise can act on and defend. Every
instruction, whether typed by an operator or issued by an agent, passes one
identity and policy boundary, runs as durable work that survives
disconnects, and lands as recordings and artifacts with full provenance.
Operators steer and audit the same state agents act on, from the same
Console.

  </picture>
</a>

## An Agentic App Platform

Agentic apps are one way an installation delivers operational intelligence
to its users. An agentic app pairs an agent that plans and acts with a live
interface that people can see and steer: an operator types an instruction,
the agent drives simulation, live stream processing, or vehicles, and the interface
shows progress, results, and evidence as they land. The capabilities behind
Veoveo's own charts, maps, forecasts, and 3D views are open to your teams.

Apps built on Veoveo are enterprise software from the first request. They
authenticate through the installation's identity provider, act within policy
scopes and Work Context access, run as durable work that outlives any single
session, and leave the same audit trail as every other actor. They
deploy with the installation, scale with it, and run in the Console or in a
compatible external host.

The platform itself is built the same way: a small team working with coding
agents can extend, deploy, and operate an installation inside the same
identity, policy, and audit boundary. The repository is organized as a
[software factory](#a-software-factory) for exactly that work.

## Product Tour

A deployment can begin with the standard server catalog, add its own
extensions, and retain the same identity and policy boundary throughout.

| Capability | What it provides |
|---|---|
| Real and simulated worlds | Governed recordings, spatial and time reference systems, traffic simulation, UAV simulation, camera streams, vehicle actuation, and 3D Tiles scenes. |
| Analysis and planning | Sandboxed DuckDB SQL, forecasting, optimization, admitted live and replay stream processing, and temporal reasoning. |
| Durable automation | Recoverable task execution, cancellation, budgets, agent wakes, and retained results for work that outlives one request. |
| Interactive apps | Interfaces that ship with each server for charts, forecasts, maps, and 3D views rendered on cluster GPUs. The same app can run in the Console or a compatible external MCP host. |
| Governed evidence | Work Context ownership, invocation provenance, immutable artifact identities, policy decisions, grants, release state, and revocable sharing. |
| Open protocol surfaces | Profiles scoped by policy over tools, resources and templates, prompts, completions, durable tasks, subscriptions, notifications, structured content, and URI identities. |
| Enterprise operation | OIDC/OAuth identity, Kubernetes scheduling and scaling, Helm packages, OCI delivery, GitOps reconciliation, audit export, and an offline installation path. |

### Operations stay connected to the work

The Console is an authenticated operating surface. It reads the same task,
policy, artifact, recording, MCP, and Kubernetes state that agents use
through the gateway.

### Recordings become governed evidence

Rerun recordings retain synchronized world, sensor, pose, and annotation data.
The Console presents each recording as one continuous timeline while bounded
segments remain an internal storage concern. Derived outputs enter the artifact
plane with ownership, provenance, release state, and effective access.

## Executable Showcases

The showcases exercise the platform against real simulator runtimes. They are
maintained as deployable workloads with typed MCP contracts, recording paths,
and acceptance tests.

### UAV flight in Isaac Sim

Address one durable pilot in ordinary language:

> Fly uav-1 to Times Square now. Read your active UAV control grant, ask Map MCP to
> resolve and route this named location from current telemetry, then use UAV MCP to admit
> and execute the mission only for your bound vehicle. Report the terminal result.

<p align="center">

  </a>
</p>

*The actual leader-camera recording accelerated 30×. The full
[26-second H.264 replay](showcase/uav-sim/assets/uav-e2e-001-flight-timelapse.mp4)
comes from the governed Recording Hub archive.*

The first accepted run covered 9.227 km in 13 minutes 10 seconds. It completed all four
admitted waypoints, arrived at 40.7580° N, 73.9855° W with zero collisions, and released
its command lease.

| Boundary | What happened |
|---|---|
| Addressed agent | `uav-1-pilot` accepted the operator message and ran one durable episode. |
| Map MCP | Resolved Times Square and returned the admitted route from current telemetry. |
| UAV Simulation MCP | Enforced the pilot-to-`uav-1` grant and protected execution with one command lease. |
| Recording Hub | Archived the leader camera, pose, telemetry, and mission lifecycle across the complete execution interval. |

The prompt carried no coordinates and granted no vehicle authority. The signed-in
Console and headless conversation projection returned the same terminal result.

## Built On The Model Context Protocol

Every capability above reaches agents and operators through the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/):
tools, resources, prompts, completions, durable tasks, subscriptions, and
notifications behind one identity and policy boundary. A client connects
once and reaches every capability; a system joins once and reaches every
client. Any compatible MCP host can drive the platform, and the Console
speaks the same protocol that agents use.

*From N × M integrations to N + M contracts.*

### Apps travel with the server

An MCP server can deliver a self-contained interface with its protocol result.
The host provides the sandbox and theme; Veoveo retains authorization, task,
artifact, and audit semantics behind each action. The View app below was invoked
from natural language and rendered by an external MCP host.

## Capability Catalog

The gateway assembles hosted servers into named profiles. An operator profile
can expose the complete catalog, while narrower profiles reduce tools and scopes
without changing the underlying server identities.

| Server | Capability |
|---|---|
| `artifact` | Artifact discovery, metadata, access grants, release state, and revocable sharing. |
| `charts` | Chart validation, compilation, static rendering, and an interactive MCP App. |
| `datasheet` | Dataset preview, column statistics, and durable profiling through the Python server template. |
| `duckdb` | Arbitrary SQL, governed ingestion, and immutable exports in bounded owner workspaces. |
| `frames` | WGS84, ECEF, ENU, and NED conversion with durable batch transforms. |
| `map` | Authoritative geography, dataset acquisition and releases, restrictions, routing, and map apps. |
| `media` | Provider-neutral model discovery, schemas, generation, artifact output, and webhook completion. |
| `optimization` | NVIDIA cuOpt vehicle routing, scenario batches, convex and MILP solving, and independently verified problem/run/solution evidence. |
| `reason` | Semantic and temporal reasoning over recordings with grounded, audited output. |
| `recording` | Recording discovery, bounded queries, subscriptions, publication, and viewer projection. |
| `rerun` | The bridged Rerun viewer surface. |
| `stream` | Operator-admitted live and replay GStreamer pipelines, typed detection profiles, and an MCP App for encoded video with overlays. |
| `time` | Authority-bound civil time, calendars, clocks, timelines, and event operations. |
| `timeseries` | Forecasting, uncertainty output, governed artifacts, and an interactive forecast app. |
| `uav-sim` | Authoritative multi-vehicle simulation, missions, datasets, simulator-hosted operator cameras, shared NVENC products, governed viewer leases, and a WebRTC App. |
| `view` | 3D Tiles views rendered on cluster GPUs, camera control, and reproducible offscreen frame capture. |

The runtime for autonomous agents adds durable episodes, detach and resume,
wakes, budgets, analytical memory, tool use, and Rerun recording. Your own
agentic apps follow the same path as domain extensions and can join the
gateway without adopting Veoveo's source build: publish an image and Helm
chart, register the server in the typed control plane, and apply the
installation's trust and policy contract. Existing enterprise systems join
the same way: put an MCP server in front of a system of record and it
becomes a governed capability of the installation.

## Enterprise Connectors

Veoveo meets an enterprise on the platforms it already runs. Connector
recipes let a coding agent install a vendor's MCP server beside the Veoveo
connector and put both to work in one session, from lakehouse queries to
satellite tasking to incident response. The
[connector catalog](docs/connectors/README.md) records the verified install
surface, auth model, and status for every platform.

## How It Fits Together

<a href="docs/images/system-map.png">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/system-map-dark.png">
    <img src="docs/images/system-map.png" alt="Live H.264 enters Stream directly while optional recording flows through a producer-local forwarder; Stream results and recording snapshots feed Reason, and agents reach 17 hosted servers through the governed gateway">
  </picture>
</a>

SurrealDB is the required coordination store. It owns durable identity,
policy, task, artifact, recording, agent, audit, and outbox records.
S3-compatible storage holds governed bytes, while RRD segments retain history
across time and space. DuckDB remains an isolated analytical runtime.

The normative boundaries and call paths are in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md) and
[`docs/TECH_DESIGN.md`](docs/TECH_DESIGN.md).

## Governance Model

Every task, recording, agent, and artifact belongs to a Work Context. The
gateway resolves the actor, delegated authority, or automated invocation before
work begins. Services retain that provenance and apply the context's ownership,
initial grants, classification, labels, and output rules.

Human users authenticate through enterprise OIDC. MCP clients use OAuth grants
bound to the protected resource, and the gateway signs short-lived service
identity assertions for hosted servers. Browser code never receives the
Console's bearer token.

Artifacts use opaque `artifact://{uuidv7}` occurrence identities. Authorized
users can receive explicit grants. A releasable artifact may also receive an
expiring, revocable read-only link with an optional download limit. Hashes
serve integrity and deduplication within a tenant, while access always flows
through grants and release links.

Read the neutral enterprise contract in
[`docs/WORK_CONTEXT_GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/WORK_CONTEXT_GOVERNANCE.md).

## Deploy Your Installation

One Helm package contract covers every environment, from a laptop cluster to
datacenter GPUs to an edge site with no outbound network. Kubernetes
schedules GPU worlds onto hardware and scales the stateless servers with
demand. Operations span sites: field producers stream recordings through the
same authenticated gateway from Kubernetes, a local network, or the public
edge, while the offline bundle serves air-gapped installations.
Installation-owned values, gateway configuration, and Secret references
compose the platform without baking customer state into the product
repository.

</a>

| Path | Use it for | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Local k3d | A real local Kubernetes cluster with registry-first image delivery and mandatory NVIDIA validation. | [`deploy/local/k3d`](deploy/local/k3d/README.md) |
| Direct Helm | A connected cluster managed by an existing platform team. | [`deploy/helm/veoveo`](deploy/helm/veoveo/README.md) |
| Enterprise GitOps | Immutable OCI charts and image digests reconciled by the installation owner's Argo CD, Flux, or equivalent controller. | [`docs/ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md) |
| Offline | A verified bundle containing runtime images, charts, schemas, checksums, image identities, and SPDX SBOMs. | [`deploy/offline`](deploy/offline/README.md) |

The [Autonomy Harness shared-responsibility contract](docs/AUTONOMY_HARNESS.md)
defines how continuously autonomous agents remain contained across identity, data,
network, compute, spend, capabilities, and side effects.

[`examples/bioma`](examples/bioma/README.md) is the executable reference for the
enterprise flow. Its hostname and infrastructure choices demonstrate one
installation; each deployment substitutes its own.

### GPU execution contract

Hardware GPU access is mandatory for optimization, simulation, perception,
reasoning, 3D rendering, Rerun, and visual acceptance workflows that declare
it. Kubernetes workloads request an NVIDIA device and fail closed when cuOpt,
CUDA, Vulkan, WebGPU, or WebGL cannot reach hardware. CPU solving and software
rendering are not supported fallbacks.

The local cluster applies the same `nvidia.com/gpu` scheduling contract used by
fielded installations. Browser verification proves that high-performance
WebGPU or WebGL reaches hardware before interacting with a visual surface. It
probes both APIs when available and stops if neither remains hardware-backed.

## Roadmap

Veoveo is working toward world models built from your operational reality:
digital twins of the sites and fleets you operate, assembled from the
geography, recordings, and telemetry an installation already governs, so
simulation, rehearsal, and prediction start from the world you actually
operate.

## Standards And Protocols

Veoveo uses published standards at interoperability boundaries and names its
repository-owned extensions explicitly. The table states the implemented
profile rather than support for every optional feature of each standard.

| Area | Implemented standards and protocols |

## Tech Stack

Veoveo is built from technology many engineers already run in production:
services that share one ontology of work, evidence, and worlds, MCP servers
in any language that speaks the protocol, a Console that runs in any modern
browser, Kubernetes and Helm underneath, SurrealDB for coordination, DuckDB
for analysis, Rerun for recordings, and NVIDIA runtimes for cuOpt decisions,
simulation, and Stream perception profiles. If these tools feel like home, so
will this repository.

## A Software Factory

The platform is designed to be extended, deployed, and operated with
coding agents. Veoveo ships no coding harness of its own: the factory
admits whatever agents a team already trusts, from a terminal session to a
full MCP host, and meets them with the material a new engineer would ask
for on day one. Engineering conventions live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
at the root and beside every hosted server, ownership and call paths in
the [`code map`](docs/CODEMAP.md), and each server carries a design
document bound to the normative [server contract](mcp/contract/DESIGN.md).

Toolchains are pinned, contracts reject invalid work before it deploys,
verification runs as executable harnesses, and deployments prove themselves
with smoke tests. The same boundary that governs human operators governs
agents: every action is authenticated, scoped by policy, bounded by
budgets, and audited, so an installation can hand real work to agents and
stay in control of what they touch.

Delivery follows the same model. A forward-deployed engineer can stand up
an installation inside the customer's environment and, working with agents
against these contracts, encode the domain's knowledge into its policies,
profiles, and extensions. What an engagement leaves behind is the factory
itself: cluster, identity, models, policies, and release process, owned
end to end by the organization that runs it.

## Develop And Verify

The service workspace, Python packages, container images, Helm charts, protocol
conformance clients, and smoke harnesses are all pinned in the repository.
Docker is required for SurrealDB-backed tests and deployment work. Native Map
builds also need a C/C++ toolchain, CMake, pkg-config, SQLite development files,
and PROJ's build dependencies.

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo xtask enforce rust
cargo test --workspace
cargo xtask enforce python
cargo xtask smoke helm-config
cargo xtask smoke sumo-push
cargo test -p veoveo-uav-sim-mcp --all-targets
PYTHONPATH=showcase/uav-sim/runtime:sdk/python/src \
  uv run --with numpy==2.5.1 --with pymavlink==2.4.49 --python python3 \
  python -m unittest discover -s showcase/uav-sim/runtime/tests -v
```

Smoke orchestration is platform code, held to the same review and testing bar
as everything it verifies. `cargo xtask smoke` builds the typed harness and
its scenario-specific local binary prerequisites, then dispatches it. Local
deployment profiles use the current tool versions pinned in
[`deploy/local/k3d/versions.env`](deploy/local/k3d/versions.env).
